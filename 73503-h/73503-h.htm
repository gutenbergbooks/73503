<h2 class="nobreak" id="EXPLORATIONS_OF_THE_NORTH_AMERICAN_COAST">EXPLORATIONS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN COAST PREVIOUS TO
THE VOYAGE OF HENRY HUDSON.</h2>

</div>

<p>One of the earliest Greek dreams,
prominent in the classic literature,
was that of a beautiful island in the
ocean at the far West. Perhaps, nevertheless,
we have been accustomed
to think of the conception too much
as a dream, a piece of pure imagination;
for it is absolutely certain, as
Pliny and Strabo prove, that bold Phenician
navigators passed far beyond
the Pillars of Hercules into the vast
Atlantic, discovering and naming the
Canary Islands, pushing their observations
far and wide. Possibly, like
Columbus, as on his first voyage, they
sailed over tranquil seas, smooth as
the rivers in Spain, and through ambient
air, soft as the air of Andalusia
in spring, until they reached the
Edenic Cuba, and thus furnished the
foundation of that Greek conception
of an exquisitely fair isle, the home of
the immortals, an Elysium on whose
happy, fragrant shores the shrilly-breathing
Zephyrus was ever piping
for the refreshment of weary souls.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the islands
in the west formed the object of many
a voyage, but even in 1306 Marino
Sanuto laid down the Canaries anew,
while Bethencourt found them in 1402.
The Azores and the Madeira Islands
appear in the chart of Pizigani in
1367, and the sailors of Prince Henry
the Navigator went to the Azores, the
Isles of the Hawks, in 1431, as preparatory
to those voyages which, beginning
with the rediscovery of the
Cape Verde Islands in 1460, were destined
to prepare the way for the circumnavigation
of Africa, and thus
open the way to the Indies by the
Cape of Good Hope. Long before
this, however, the Spaniards were
credited with the establishment of
colonies in the western ocean, and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the globe of Martin Behaim, in 1482,
may be seen the legend crediting
Spanish bishops with the founding of
seven cities in a distant island in the
year 734. In 1498 De Ayala, the
Spanish ambassador in England, reported
to his sovereign that the city of
Bristol had for seven years sent out
ships in search of the island of Brazil
and the Seven Cities, which were
commonly laid down in maps, together
with the great island of “Antillia,”
by many supposed to refer to the
American Continent.</p>

<p>In the time of Columbus enterprise
was generally active, and men everywhere
were eager to realize the prediction
of Seneca, who declared that
the Ultima Thule, the extreme bounds
of the earth, would in due time be
reached. But Columbus would win
something more than beautiful islands.
He aimed at a continent, and would
reach the eastern border of Asia by
sailing west, in accordance with the
early philosophers, who had accepted
the spherical form of the earth, not
dreaming that, instead of a few islands,
scattered like gems in the ocean,
a mighty continent barred the way.
Dominated by the antique notions of
the classic writers, Columbus, after encountering
and overcoming every discouragement,
finally sailed towards
the golden West, finding the voyage
a pleasant excursion, interrupted only
by the occasional fears of the sailors,
lest the light breeze might prevent
their return to Spain, by blowing all
the time the one way. At a given
point of the voyage Columbus met
with an experience, and made a decision,
that perhaps determined the
destiny of North America. October
7, 1492, Martin Pinson saw flocks of
parrots flying southwest, and argued
that the birds were returning to land,
which must lie in that direction. He
accordingly advised the Admiral to
change the course of the ship. Columbus
realized the force of the argument
and knew the significance of the
flights of birds, the hawk having piloted
the Portuguese to the Azores.
He was now sailing straight for the
coast of North Carolina, and must inevitably
have discovered our continent,
but the parrots were accepted as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
guides, the course was changed to
the southwest, and in due time the
Island of San Salvador rose before
their expectant eyes. All his efforts,
therefore, after this memorable voyage,
were devoted to the West Indies,
and in the fond belief that he had
reached fair Cathay. Consequently
John Cabot was left to discover North
America at least one year before
Columbus sighted the southern portion
of the western continent. Even
then Columbus held that South America
was a part of India, and he finally
died in ignorance of the fact that he
had reached a new world.</p>

<p>His error proved a most fortunate
one for the English-speaking people;
since, if he had confined on the western
course, the Carolinas would have
risen to view, and the splendors and
riches of the Antilles might have
remained unknown long enough for
Spanish enterprise to establish itself
on the Atlantic coast. This done, the
magnificent Hudson would have become
the objective point of Spanish
enterprise, and a Spanish fortress and
castle would to-day look down from
the Weehawken Heights, the island of
New York yielding itself up as the
site of a Spanish city.</p>

<p>The mistake of Columbus, however,
was supplemented by what, perhaps,
may properly be called a series of
blunders, all of them more or less
fortunate, or at least in the interest of
a type of civilization very unlike that
of Spain, especially as expanded and
interpreted in Central and South America.
It is, therefore, to the series of
nautical adventures following the age
Columbus, and extending down to the
voyage of Henry Hudson, the Englishman,
in 1609, that this article is
mainly devoted, showing how this
entire region was preserved from permanent
occupation by Europeans,
until it was colonized by the Walloons
under the Dutch, who providentially
prepared the way for the English.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>ISABELLA OF SPAIN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First, however, it may be interesting
to glance at voyages made during
the Middle Ages, considering whether
they had any possible connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
with the region now occupied by the
city of New York.</p>

<p>That Northmen visited the shores
of North America no reasonable inquirer
any longer doubts. Even Mr.
George Bancroft, who for about half a
century cast grave reflections upon
the voyages of the Northmen, and
inspired disbelief in many quarters,
finally abandoned all allusion to the
subject, and subsequently explained
that in throwing discredit upon the
Icelandic narratives he had fallen into
error.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The probability now seems to be
that the Irish had become acquainted
with a great land at the west, and
gave it the name of “Greenland,”
which name was simply applied by
Eric the Red to a separate region,
when he went to the country now
known as Greenland in the year 985.
The next year Biarne Heriulfsson, following
Eric, was blown upon the
north Atlantic coast, and in the year
1000-1 Leif, son of Eric, went in
quest of the land seen by Biarne,
reaching what is generally recognized
as New England. Others followed in
1002 and 1005, while from 1006 to
1009 Thorfinn Karlsefne visited the
same region, then known as “Vinland
the Good,” and made a serious but
abortive effort to found a colony.
Freydis, daughter of Eric the Red,
visited New England in 1010 to 1012.
Vague accounts in the Icelandic
chronicles tell of a visit of one Are
Marson to a region called White Man’s
Land (Hvitrammanaland) in 983, ante-dating
Eric’s appearance in Greenland.
We also hear of Biörn Asbrandson
in 999, and of the voyage of
Gudlaugson in 1027. Certain geographical
fragments refer to Bishop
Eric, of Greenland, as searching for
Wineland in 1121, while in 1357 a
small Icelandic ship visited “Markland,”
the present Nova Scotia.
The voyages of Asbrandson and of
Gudlaugson are generally viewed as
standing connected with a region extending
from New England to Florida,
known as White Man’s Land, or Ireland
the Great. In these accounts
there is found no definite allusion to
the region of the Hudson, though
Karlsefne’s explorations may have
extended some distance southwesterly
from Rhode Island; while later adventurers,
who came southward and
followed the course of Are Marson,
who was discovered in the country by
Asbrandson, must have sailed along
our shores. Still no record of such a
visit now remains, which is not at all
singular, since many a voyager went
by, both before and afterwards, with
the same failure to signalize the event
for the information of posterity.
“They had no poet and they died.”</p>

<p>Turning to the voyages of the
Welsh, who, some think, reached the
western continent about the year
1170, led by Madoc, Prince of Wales,
there is the same failure to connect
them with this region. Catlin, who
visited the White or Mandan Indians,
supposes that the Welch sailed down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the coast to the Bay of Mexico and
ascended the Mississippi; although
there is just as much reason to hold,
if the Mandans were their descendants,
that they entered the continent
and found their way westward from
the region of Massachusetts or
New York. The latter, however,
might be favored, for the reason
that our noble river forms to-day
the most popular and certainly
the most splendid gateway to the
far West.</p>

<p>The voyages of the Zeno
brothers, who are believed by
most competent critics to have
reached America about the close
of the fourteenth century, and
who left a chart, first published
in 1558, show a country called
“Drogeo,” a vast region which
stretched far to the south, whose
inhabitants were clothed in skins,
and subsisted by hunting, being
armed with bows and arrows,
and living in a state of war.
The description would apply to our
part of the coast. At this period the
Red Indians had come from the
west, and dispersed the original inhabitants,
known to the Northmen as
Skraellings. The red man on this
coast was an invader and conqueror,
not the original proprietor of the land.
In a very brief time, however, he forgot
his own traditions and indulged in
the belief that he was the first holder
of this region, which was deeded to
him by the Great Father in fee simple;
and it was in this belief that, in turn,
the simple savage conveyed vast
tracts of territory to the white man, in
consideration of trinkets and fire-water.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="illus04" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus04.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SEBASTIAN CABOT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So far as can be discovered, the
Skraelling was the first proprietor, and
by the Skraelling is meant what is
called the “Glacial Man,” who appeared
on this coast when the great
ice-sheet that once covered the highlands
of America was melting and
sliding into the sea. The evidences
of the so-called glacial man are found
at the present time in the gravels of
the Trenton River, of New Jersey,
consisting of stone implements that
seem to have been lost while engaged
in hunting and fishing. With the disappearance
of the ice and the moderation
of the climate, these men of
the ice-period spread along the Atlantic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
coast from Labrador to Florida,
their descendants being the modern Eskimo
and Greenlander, whose ancestors
were driven northward by the red
man when he conquered the country.
The immediate region of the Hudson
has thus far afforded none of the
stone implements that abound at
Trenton yet it may be regarded as
beyond question that the first inhabitant
of New York was a glacial man,
ruder than the rudest red savage, and
in appearance resembling the present
Eskimo.</p>

<p>We turn, however, to note what, in
this immediate connection, may be
styled the course of maritime enterprise,
the first voyage of interest in
connection with our subject being the
voyage said to have been made by
Sebastian Cabot along the coast from
Newfoundland in 1515. Upon this initial
voyage many Englishmen based
their claim, but in the present state of
knowledge the expedition itself is considered
debatable by some. That John
Sebastian Cabot saw the continent in
1498, or one year before Columbus
saw South America, can hardly be
doubted; but convincing testimony is
required respecting the alleged voyage
down this part of the coast in 1515. If
we accept the voyage as a fact, this expedition,
whose objective point was
Newfoundland, may be regarded as
the first known English expedition to
these shores.</p>

<p>Before this time, however, the Portuguese
were very active, and had run
the coast from Florida to Cape Breton,
evidence of which they left in the
“Cantino” Map, and in the Ptolemy
of 1513. This was in continuation of
the enterprise of the Costas, or “Cortereals,”
who made voyages to the
north in 1500-1-2. The expedition
made a long our coast at this period left
no memorials now known, save the
maps to which allusion has been made.
As early as 1520 the Spaniards began
to navigate to the north from the West
Indies, and in that year Ayllon reached
the coast of Carolina, on an expedition
to capture slaves, though Martyr
speaks of the country he visited as
“near the Baccaloos,” a term applied
at that time to the region far south of
Newfoundland. Nevertheless, in the
year 1524, we reach a voyage of deep
interest, for in this year the Bay of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
New York comes distinctly into view,
Europeans being known for the first
time to pass the Narrows. Reference
is here made to the voyage of the celebrated
Italian, Giovanni da Verrazano,
in the service of Francis I. of France.</p>

<p>This celebrated navigator is supposed
to have been the son of Piero Andrea
di Bernardo de Verrazano and Fiametta
Capella. He was born at Val di
Greve, a little village near Florence, in
the year 1485. At one time a portrait
of Verrazano adorned the walls of a
gallery in Florence. This portrait<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was
engraved for the well-known work entitled,
“Uomini Illustri Toscani.” A
medal was also struck in his honor,
but no copy of it can now be found.
The family, nevertheless, appears to
have maintained a definite place in
local history, the last known Florentine
representative being the Cavaliere Andrea
da Verrazano, who died in 1819.</p>

<p>Verrazano, the great explorer of the
American coast, seems to have had a
large experience as a sailor upon the
Mediterranean, eventually entering the
service of Francis I. of France, as a
privateer or corsair, in which calling
Columbus and many of the old navigators
shone conspicuously, the profession
at that time being quite creditable,
even though dangerous. In 1523 Verrazano
was engaged in capturing Spanish
ships that brought the treasures of
Montezuma from Mexico. In the following
year he made his voyage to
America, and one statement makes it
appear that, subsequently, he was
captured by the Spaniards and executed.
Ramusio tells us that on a
second voyage he was made a prisoner
by the savages, and was roasted and
eaten in the sight of his comrades. The
light which we have at the present time
does not suffice for the settlement of
the question relating to the manner of
his death, but we have overwhelming
evidence of the reality of his voyage in
1524, which is vouched for by invaluable
maps and relations contained in a
lengthy letter addressed to his employer,
Francis I.</p>

<p>This letter is of unique interest, especially
for the reason that it contains
the first known post-Columbian description
of the North Atlantic coast,
and the first pen-picture of the Bay and
Harbor of New York. In connection
with our local annals Giovanni da
Verrazano must hold a high place. As
might be supposed, the narrative of
Verrazano has exerted a commanding
influence upon historical literature.
For more than three centuries it has
furnished quotations. This fact has
not prevented one or two occasional
writers from questioning the authenticity
of the Letter of Verrazano, though
the discussion which followed simply
resulted in the production of additional
proof, especially that found in two
maps previously unknown, establishing
the authenticity of both voyage
and letter, and taking the subject from
the field of controversy.</p>

<p>The voyage of Verrazano was projected
in 1523. On April 25th of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
year, Silveira, the Portuguese embassador
at the Court of Francis I., wrote
to his master: “By what I hear, Maestro
Joas Verrazano, who is going on the
discovery of Cathay, has not left up to
date for want of opportunity, and because
of differences, I understand, between
himself and his men.... I
shall continue to doubt unless he takes
his departure.” It appears that he first
went to sea with four ships, but met a
severe gale and was obliged to return
to port, apparently with the loss of
two ships. After making repairs, he
sailed for the Spanish coast alone in
the Dolphin, the captain of the remaining
ship leaving Verrazano, and giving
color to the story of Silveira, that he
had quarreled with his men. In the
Carli correspondence, there is a reference
to one Brunelleschi, “who went
with him and unfortunately turned
back.”</p>

<p>On January 17, 1524 (old style),
Verrazano finally sailed from a barren
rocky island, southeast of Madeira,
though Carli erroneously says that he
departed from the Canaries. The discrepancy
is useful, in that it proves an
absence of collusion between writers
in framing a fictitious voyage. Steering
westward until February 14th, he
met a severe hurricane, and then
veered more to the north, holding the
middle course, as he feared to sail
southward, by the accustomed route
to the West Indies, less he should fall
into the hands of the Spaniards,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who
with the Portuguese, claimed the entire
New World, in accordance with
the decree of Pope Alexander. Hence
the navigator, to avoid the Spanish
cruisers, held his course westward in
sunshine and storm, until the shores of
the American continent appeared
above the waves. March 7th he saw
land which “never before had been
seen by any one either in ancient or
modern times,” a statement that he
was lead into by the desire to claim
something for France. He knew that
his statement could not be exactly
true, because, like all the navigators of
his day, he was familiar with the
Ptolemy of 1513, containing a rude
map of the coast from Florida to 55°
N. Evidently he did not attach any
value to the explorations of the Portuguese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
as represented by the maps,
and hence, after sighting land in the
neighborhood of 34° N., he sailed
southward fifty leagues to make sure
of connecting with the actual exploration
of the Portuguese, and then began
coasting northward in search of a route
through the land to Cathay. Columbus
died in 1508, believing that he had
reached Cathay, but in the day of Verrazano
it was understood by many
that the land found formed a new continent,
though this was not everywhere
accepted until the middle of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>Navigating northward, Verrazano
reached the neighborhood of the present
site of Charlestown, South Carolina,
describing the country substantially
as it appears to-day, bordered with
low sand-hills, the sea making inlets,
while beyond were beautiful fields,
broad plains, and vast forests. On
landing they found the natives timid,
but by friendly signs the savages became
assured, and freely approached
the French followers of Verrazano,
wondering at their dress and complexion,
just as, in 1584, Barlow, in the
same locality, said that the natives
wondered “at the whiteness of our
skins.” The descriptions of Verrazano
were so faithful that Barlow, though
without credit, employed his language,
especially when he says, speaking of
the forests before reaching the land,
“We smelt so sweet and strong a
smell as if we had been in the midst
of some delicate garden.” As Verrazano
held northward, his descriptions
continued to exhibit the same fidelity,
being used by Barlow and confirmed
by Father White. They were also
confirmed by Dermer, who ran the
coast in 1619, finding the shores low,
without stones, sandy, and, for the
most part, harborless. When near
Chesapeake Bay, Verrazano found that
the people made their canoes of logs,
as described by Barlow and Father
White. The grapes-vines were also
seen trailing from the trees, as indicated
by these writers; and, speaking
of the fruit, Verrazano says that it was
“very sweet and pleasant.” This language,
being used early in the season,
led to the rather thoughtless objection
that Verrazano never made the voyage.
The simple explanation is that the
natives were accustomed to preserving
fruits by drying them; and hence Hudson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
in 1609, found dried “currants,”
which were sweet and good, meaning
by the word, “currant” what all
meant at that period, namely, a dried
grape. The letter of Verrazano contains
exaggerations, like all similar
productions. Cortez made Montezuma
drink wine from cellars in a country
where both wine and cellars were unknown.
Cartier caused figs to grow
in Canada, and Eric the Red called
the ice-clad hills of the land west of
Iceland, “Greenland.” Verrazano,
however, falls into none of these flat
contradictions, and often the objection
to the authenticity of the voyage has
grown out of the ignorance of the
critic of very common things.</p>

<p>Leaving Delaware Bay, Verrazano
coasted northward, sailing by day and
coming to anchor at night, finally
reaching the Bay of New York, which
forms the culmination of the interest
of the voyage, so far as our present
purpose is concerned. After proceeding
a distance roughly estimated, on
the decimal system, at a hundred
leagues, he says: “We found a very
pleasant situation among some little
steep hills, through which a very large
river (grandissima riviera), deep at its
mouth, forced its way to the sea,” and
he adds: “From the sea to the estuary
of the river any ship might pass, with
the help of the tide, which rises eight
feet.” This is about the average rise
at the present time, and the fact is one
that could have been learned only from
actual observation. It points to the
“bar” as then existing, and gives the
narrative every appearance of reality.
Many things observed were noted in
what Verrazano calls a “little book,”
and evidently it was from data contained
in this book that his brother
compiled the map which illustrates
the voyage. Verrazano, however,
was cautious, as he possessed only
one ship, and he says: “As we were
riding at anchor in a good berth we
would not venture up in our ship without
a knowledge of the mouth; therefore,”
he says, “we took the boat and
entering the river, we found the country
on its banks well-peopled, the inhabitants
not differing much from the
others, being dressed out with feathers
of birds of various colors.” The
natives, by their action, showed that
their faith in human nature had not
been spoiled by men leading expeditions
like those of Ayllon in 1521, to
the Carolinas for slaves. They were
still a simple and unaffected people,
not spoiled by European contact, as in
the time of Hudson, and accordingly,
unlike the sly people met where Ayllon’s
kidnappers had done their work,
“they came towards us with evident
admiration, and showing us where we
could most securely land with our
boat.” Continuing, the narrative says:
“We passed up this river about half a
league, when we found it formed a most
beautiful lake, three leagues in circuit,
upon which were rowing thirty or
more of their small boats from one
shore to the other, filled with multitudes
who came to see us.” This
“beautiful lake” (bellissimo lago) was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
so far as one is able to judge, the Bay
of New York.</p>

<p>Verrazano passed the bar and anchored
at the entrance of the Narrows,
the position being defined as between
“little steep hills” (infra piccoli colli
eminenti), which exactly describes the
heights of Staten Island, and the shore
of Long Island as far up as Yellow
Hook, the present Bay Ridge. Then
far and wide the spacious harbor was
surrounded by well-wooded shores,
upon which Verrazano and his followers,
evidently the first of Europeans
to enter the port, gazed with admiration.
It would appear that they did
not cross the harbor, but they probably
espied in the distance the island
upon which our city now stands,
clothed in the dusky brown, touched
only here and there with patches of
the evergreen pine. Nothing is said
of the beauty of the foliage in this
region, since in March none could have
been apparent, though the population
was evidently numerous, and from the
shores the smoke of many wigwams
was seen by day, with the distant illuminations
that filled the eye of the
sailor by night. Verrazano little
dreamed of the value of the situation.
It never occurred to him that on this
“beautiful lake” would one day stand
a city which in wealth and importance
would eclipse the far-famed city of
Montezuma. The situation was pleasing,
but it did not offer what Verrazano
sought, namely, an opening to India.
He learned that he was at the mouth
of a swift river that poured out a
powerful tide from between the hills,
and he saw the unreasonableness of
continuing his search at this place.
What conclusion he might have reached
eventually, had his stay been prolonged,
we cannot predict, but he was
soon hurried away. He says: “All of
a sudden, as it is wont to happen to
navigators, a violent contrary wind
blew in from the sea and forced us to
return to our ship, greatly regretting to
leave this region, which seemed so
commodious and delightful, and which
we supposed must contain great riches,
as the hills showed many indications
of minerals.” By a glance at the chart
it will be seen that the ship lay in a
position in the lower bay perilous for a
stranger, and in case of a gale she
would be in danger of being driven
upon the shore of either Long Island
or Staten Island. Verrazano would not
take his ship through the Narrows into
the harbor, on account of his ignorance
of the situation, and when the wind
set upon shore from the sea he at once
decided to get out of danger. Accordingly
he says: “Weighing anchor we
sailed fifty leagues towards the east,
the coast stretching in that direction,
and always in sight of it.” Thus he
coasted along the shores of Long Island,
and “discovered an island in
triangular form, some ten leagues
from the main land, in size about equal
to the Island of Rhodes.” This was
Block Island, and we mention the circumstance
here, in order that the
reader may appreciate the fact that
Verrazano first visited New York, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
that he properly describes the coast.
Block Island is distinctly a triangular
island. Then he went to a harbor in
the main, identified as Newport Harbor.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The natives who appeared in
the harbor, it will be noticed, had some
thirty small boats (barchettes). The
word itself does not indicate the manner
of their construction, but, when at
Newport, Verrazano says distinctly,
that these barchettes were hollowed
out of single logs of wood (un sole
fusto di legno). The Dutch found the
natives using the same kind of boats
here in the early days, though the bark
canoe was also employed. The
objections urged against the authenticity
of the voyage of Verrazano have
simply resulted in fresh investigation
and the production of proofs that establish
beyond question the truth of
the narrative, which is supplemented
by a long series of maps. The series
begin with the map of Verrazano,
drawn in the year 1529, by Hieronimo
da Verrazano, brother of the navigator,
and the Maijolla map, which also represents
the voyage, giving particulars
not given in the narrative of Verrazano.
The map of Verrazano is now preserved
in the museum of the “Propaganda
Fide” at Rome,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and forms a
wonderful advance upon the Ptolemy
of 1513, which, after passing Florida,
is vague and, upon the whole, quite
useless as respects our present purpose,
since it shows no knowledge of the
Bay and Harbor of New York, and
calls for no particular notice here.</p>

<p>It has already been observed that
much of that which is wanting in the
Letter is furnished by the map of Verrazano,
noticeably the Shoals of Cape
Cod. The map was constructed by
the aid of the “little book,” in which,
as Verrazano told Francis I., there were
many particulars of the voyage, and it
forms the best sixteenth century map
of the coast now known to be extant
in the original form. After Verrazano
the delineation of the coast, as a whole,
gradually, in the neglect of cartography,
became more and more corrupt,
culminating in the monstrous distortions
of Mercator.</p>

<p>On the map of Verrazano the Cape
of Florida is most unmistakable, though
by an error in following Ptolemy, the
draftsman placed the cape nine degrees
too high, thus vitiating the latitudes,
also failing to eliminate the
error before reaching Cape Breton.
This however, does not prevent us
from recognizing the leading points of
the coast. At Cape “Olimpo” we
strike Cape Hatteras, and near “Santanna”
is the mouth of Chesapeake
Bay. “Palamsina,” a corruption perhaps
of Pallavicino, marks the entrance
to the Delaware. “Lamuetto,” possibly
Bonivet after the general of that
name, distinguishes what apparently
was intended for Sandy Hook; while
“San Germano” and “La Victoria”
stand on the lower Bay of New York.
Verrazano did not know enough about
the river of “the steep hills” to enable
him to give it a pronounced name,
though in after times the Hudson, as
we shall see, was called “the river of
the mountains.” It will be readily
recognized that San Germano is a name
given out of compliment to his patron
by Verrazano, as it recalls the splendid
palace of Francis I., at St. Germaine-en-Lay.
If circumstances had favored,
the name of Francis might have been
affixed to a great French metropolis at
the mouth of the Hudson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The influence of the Verrazano Map
upon succeeding charts was most
marked down even to 1610, when all
obscurity in regard to the position of
the Harbor of New York had passed
away. The same is true of the exhibition
of the relation of New York Bay
to Rhode Island and the Island of
Luisa. The influence of Verrazano
upon the Globe of Vlpius, 1542, was
most emphatic, as will be noticed
later; though it is to be remembered
that Verrazano’s voyage was pictured
on the Map of Maijolla before the Verrazano
Map was drawn, notes from
Verrazano, probably out of the “little
book” that he mentions, affording the
requisite material. Verrazano evidently
furnished an abundance of names for
localities, and the various draftsmen
seemed to have exercised their judgment
to some extent respecting their
use. It would, however, prove wearisome
to the reader to peruse any minute
statements of the contents of the many
maps that indicate the Bay of New
York; since neither the authenticity
nor the influence of the voyage of Verrazano
can now be questioned. In directions
where it was never suspected,
the Letter of Verrazano to Francis I.
had a decided influence, as will be
noted hereafter, though attention may
again be called to the fact that Barlow,
in his voyage to North Carolina, 1584,
used the Letter without credit, according
to the custom of the time; while,
when Gosnold visited New England,
in 1602, he sailed, as tacitly acknowledged,
with the Letter of Verrazano,
translated by Hakluyt as his guide.</p>

<p>Next, however, the reader’s attention
must be directed to the voyage of Estevan
Gomez, who followed Verrazano
in 1525. This adventurer was a Portuguese
in the service of Spain. While
Verrazano was abroad on his
voyage, Gomez attended the nautical
congress at Badajos, in Spain, when,
we are told, Sebastian Cabot was present.
At this congress Portugal opposed
the plan presented for an expedition
to the Indies, being very jealous, as
usual, of the power of Spain. The differences
of the two powers were nevertheless
reconciled, and the king of
Spain, with the aid of several merchants,
fitted out a caravel and put
Gomez in command. Gomez, if he did
not stand as high as some men of his
time, was a navigator of experience.
In 1519 he sailed as chief pilot with
Magellan, but incurred much odium
by leaving him in the Straits which
now bear Magellan’s name, and returning
to Spain. Peter Martyr, who
gives an account of the congress at
Badajos, says: “It is decreed that one
Stephanus Gomez, himself a skilful
navigator, shall go another way,
whereby, between Baccalaos and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Florida, long since our countries, he
says he will find out a way to Cataia.
Only one ship, a caravel, is furnished
for him,” and, the chronicler continues,
“he will have no other thing in charge
than to search out whether any passage
to the great Chan from among the
various windings and vast compassing
of this our ocean is to be found.” Of
the voyage out from Spain few particulars
are now available, though the account
of the return was penned by
Martyr subsequently to November 13,
1525, and probably before the close of
the year. The voyage was, upon the
whole, a short one. Martyr, however,
says that he returned at the end of
“ten months,” while Navarrete states
that he sailed in February. Galvano
tells us that, having failed to obtain
the command of an expedition to the
Moluccas, he went on the coast of the
new world in search of a passage to
India, observing that “the Earl Don
Fernando de Andrada, and the doctor
Beltram, and the merchant Christopher
de Serro, furnished a galleon for him,
and he went from Groine, in Gallicia,
to the Island of Cuba, and to the Cape
of Florida, sailing by day because he
knew not the land.” Galvano tells us,
likewise, that he passed the Bay of
Angra and the river Enseada, and so
“went over to the other side, reaching
Cape Razo in 46° N.” This means that
he sailed up from Florida past the
coast of Maine. Martyr, writing after
the return of Gomez, indulges in a
strain of ridicule, and says: “He,
neither finding the Straight, nor Cataia,
which he promised, returned back in
ten months after his departure;” and
continues: “I always thought and
supposed this worthy man’s fancies to
be vain and frivolous. Yet he wanted
not for suffrages and voices in his favor
and defense.” Still, Martyr admits that
“he found pleasant and profitable
countries agreeable with our parallels
and degrees of the pole.”</p>

<p>The results of the voyage along
the coast from Florida to Newfoundland
are indicated on the Map of Ribeiro,
1529, which represents a new
exploration, as nothing seems to have
been borrowed from either the voyage
of Verrazano or from the voyages
made by the Portuguese, with the exception
that Ribeiro used old Portuguese
maps of Newfoundland, which
was the case with Verrazano. We
must, however, confine our observations
to things that relate to this immediate
region, and notice what the
accompanying maps so fully exhibit,
the difference of the delineation of
Sandy Hook and Long Island. On
the Ribeiro Map Sandy Hook appears
as “Cabo de Arenas,” the Sandy Cape,
exaggerated in size, while Long Island
is hardly distinguishable, as the
coast line runs too close to the north.
It is indicated by the section of the
coast between two rivers, “Montana
Vue,” evidently one of the hills of
Long Island that the navigator now
views from the sea. On the Verrazano
Map, the region of Sandy Hook
is “Lamuetto” and “Lungavilla,”
while Long Island is indicated as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
part of the mainland, bearing the
names of “Cabo de Olimpo” and
“Angolesme,” the bay of “San Germano”
lying between. The delineations
of Verrazano exhibit his short
stay and hasty departure, while the
survey of Gomez must have occupied
more time, at least around Sandy
Hook. That this map resulted from
the voyage of Gomez is evident from
the legend, which calls the land
“Tierra de Estevan Gomez;” (the
country of Stephen Gomez) while
eastward, where the coast of Maine is
delineated, is the “Arcipelago” of
Gomez. On this Map of Ribeiro the
lower Bay of New York is indicated
by “E. de S. Xpoal,” with several
Islands. A river appears between
this bay, given in later documents as
Bay of “St. Chrispstabel,” and Long
Island, but the name of the river is
not given. “B. de S. Antonio,” however,
is given which indicates the
upper bay or harbor, and subsequently
we shall see the river itself indicated
as the river “San Antonio,”
while the place of Sandy Hook in the
old cartography will be fully established
and identified with Cape de
Arenas. Ribeiro evidently had pretty
full notes of the calculations and observations
of Gomez.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus09" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus09.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>FRA. DRAKE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the reverential old navigators
were often in the habit of marking
their progress in connection with
prominent days in the Calendar, it
is reasonable to suppose that the Hudson
was discovered by Gomez on the
festival of St. Anthony, which falls on
January 17. Navarrete indeed says
that he left Spain in February, but the
accounts are more or less confusing.
If Martyr, who is more particular, is
correct, and Gomez was absent “ten
months,” he must have sailed early in
December, which would have brought
him to our coast on the festival of the
celebrated Theban Father. At this
time the navigator would have seen
the country at its worst. Evidently
he made no extended exploration of
the river, as in January it is often
loaded with ice and snow.</p>

<p>Gomez was laughed at by the courtiers,
and had no disposition to return
to the American coast. The legend
on the Map of Ribeiro proclaiming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
his discovery, that is, exploration of
the coast, declared that here were to
be found “many trees and fruits similar
to those in Spain,” but Martyr
contemptuously exclaims, “What
need have we of these things that are
common to all the people of Europe?
To the South! to the South!” he ejaculates,
“for the great and exceeding
riches of the Equinoxial,” adding,
“They that seek riches must not go to
the cold and frozen North.” Gems,
spices, and gold were the things coveted
by Spain, and our temperate
region, with its blustering winters, did
not attract natures accustomed to
soft Andalusian air.</p>

<p>After the voyage of Gomez, which,
failing to find a route to the Indies,
excited ridicule, there is nothing of
special interest to emphasize in this
connection until 1537. In the meanwhile,
the English were active, and in
1527 two ships, commanded by Captain
John Rut, were in American
waters. It has been claimed that he
sailed the entire coast, often sending
men on land “to search the state of
these unknown regions,” and it has
been affirmed that this is “the first
occasion of which we are distinctly
informed that Englishmen landed on
the coast.” Also that, “after Cabot,
this was the second English expedition
which sailed along the entire east
coast of the United States, as far as
South Carolina.” Granting, however,
that the expedition of Rut actually extended
down the American coast,
there is no proof that he gave any attention
to the locality of the Hudson.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A SECTION OF THE<br>MAP OF ALONZO CHAVES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We turn now to the account of our
particular locality, as given by Oviedo
in 1537, who wrote an account of the
coast based largely upon the Map of
Alonzo Chaves. It appears that, in
1536, Charles V. ordered that the official
charts should “be examined and
corrected by experienced men, appointed
for that purpose.” Acting
under their instructions, Alonzo Chaves
drew up a chart, embodying the information
that he had been able to
collect from maps and narratives. It
is evident that he had notes of the
voyage of Gomez, and that he used
the Ribeiro Map, but he had no information
about the voyage of Verrazano
or that of Cartier in 1534. His
delineation of the coast began in the
Bay of Mexico, and extended to Newfoundland.
Oviedo, in his “History
of the Indies,” used this map, and
describes the coast by its aid. The
Map of Chaves does not appear to be
accessible, but its American features
have been reconstructed from the
descriptions of Oviedo, and this portion
of the Map is given herewith, the
latitudes and distances being exactly
preserved. From the Cape of Florida,
Oviedo moves northward in his descriptions,
which are distinctly recognizable.
“Cabo de Sanct Johan”
stands at the mouth of the Chesapeake,
and from this place “Cabo de
los Arenas” is thirty leagues to the
north-northeast. The latter cape is
38° 20′ N. From “Arenas” the coast
runs thirty leagues to “Cabo de Santiago,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
which is 39° 20′ N. On this
map Sandy Hook appears as Cape
Santiago, but generally the name of
“Arenas,” the Sandy Cape, is affixed
to the Hook<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. Oviedo, on reaching the
end of Sandy Hook, proceeds to give
an unmistakable delineation of the
Bay and Harbor of New York, and of
the river which is now known as the
Hudson. “Thence,” continues Oviedo,
with his eye on the Map of
Chaves, “the coast turns southwest
twenty leagues to the Bay of Sanct
Christobal, which is in 39°, passes said
bay, and goes thirty leagues to Rio de
Sanct Antonio, north and south with
the bottom of this bay; and the ‘Rio
de Sanct Antonio’ is in 41° N.” Dr.
Kohl says that “it is impossible to
give a more accurate description of
the Hudson River,” but this is not
quite true. It was an excellent description
for that period, considering
the material at hand; yet it must be
remembered that all the distances are
given as general estimates on the
decimal system. Besides, the Map of
Chaves, like all the maps, was drawn
on a small scale, and Sandy Hook and
the Lower Bay are both exaggerated,
as on the Map of Ribeiro, which will
be seen by a comparison of the two
maps, placed side by side to facilitate
investigation. Both Ribeiro and Chaves
had erroneous measurements of distances,
and made the Lower Bay quite
a large gulf, while the latitude of
“Rio Sanct Antonio” is placed one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
degree too high. Ribeiro, however,
gave the Hook its right name,
“Arenas.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The size of the Hook is
exaggerated on the Maijolla Map,
1527, though not on the Verrazano,
1529. These things show free-hand
drawing on the part of the mapmakers,
and defective rule-of-thumb
measurements by the navigator, who
probably viewed the waters behind
the Hook when veiled in mist, failing
to test his own estimates.</p>

<p>Oviedo says that “from the Rio de
Sanct Antonio the coast runs northeast
one-fourth east forty leagues to a point
(punta), that on the western side it
has a river called the Buena Madre,
and on the eastern part, in front of
(de lante) the point, is the Bay of
Sanct Johan Baptista, which point
(punta) is 41° 30′ N.”; or, rather, correcting
the error of one degree, in 40°
30′ N. This point is Montauk Point,
Long Island being taken as a part of
the main. The Thames River in Connecticut
answers to the River of the
Good Mother, and the Bay of John
Baptist is evidently the Narragansett.
Oviedo then goes on to the region of
Cape Cod, varying from the general
usage, and calling it “Arrecifes,” or
the Reef Cape, instead of “Cabe de
Baxos,” which signifies substantially
the same thing. Under the circumstances,
the description of Long Island
is remarkably exact, as its shore
trends northward almost exactly half
a degree in running to Montauk Point.
What, therefore, lies on either side of
the River San Antonio fixes beyond
question the locality of the Hudson,
and proves that it was clearly known
from the time of Gomez to 1537.</p>

<p>The next navigator whose work
touched our part of the coast was
Jehan or Jean Allefonsce, who, in
1542, came to Canada as pilot of
Roberval, and gained considerable
knowledge of the North Atlantic
shores. This hardy sailor was a native
of Saintonge, a village of Cognac,
France. After following the sea for a
period of more than forty years, and
escaping many dangers, he finally received
a mortal wound while engaged
in a naval battle in the harbor of Rochelle.
Melin Saint-Gelais wrote a
sonnet in his honor during the year
1559. It can hardly be doubted that
Allefonsce himself ran down the coast
in one of the ships of Roberval, probably
when returning to France.</p>

<p>With the aid of Paulin Secalart he
wrote a cosmographical description,
which included Canada and the West
Indies, with the American coast.
Very recognizable descriptions are
given as far down as Cape Cod and
the islands to the southward. The
manuscript also possesses interest in
connection with the region of the
Hudson, though farther south the description
becomes still more available.</p>

<p>Allefonsce after disposing of the
region of New England, turns southward,
and says: “From the Norombega
River,” that is, the Penobscot,
“the coast runs west-southwest about
two hundred and fifty leagues to a
large bay (anse) running inland about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
twenty leagues, and about twenty-nine
leagues wide. In this bay there
are four islands close together. The
entrance to the bay is by 38° N., and
the said islands lie in 39° 30′ N. The
source of this bay has not been explored,
and I do not know whether it
extends further on.... The whole
coast is thickly populated, but I had
no intercourse with them.” Continuing,
he says: “From this bay the
coast runs west-northwest about forty-six
leagues. Here you come upon a
great fresh-water river, and at its entrance
is a sand island.” What is
more, he adds: “Said island is 39°
49′ N.”</p>

<p>From the description of Allefonsce,
it is evident that the “great fresh-water
river” is the Hudson, described
five years before by Oviedo, out of
the Map of Chaves, as the River of St.
Anthony, while the “island of sand”
was Sandy Hook.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Turning from the manuscript of Allefonsce
to the printed cosmography, we
discover that the latter is only an
abridgement, it being simply said that
after leaving Norombega, the coast
turns to the south-southeast to a cape
which is high land (Cape Cod), and has
a great island and three or four small
isles. New York and the entire coast
south have no mention. The manuscript,
however, suffices for our purpose
and proves that the coast was
well known.</p>

<p>It has been already stated that it
would be impossible to say when the
first Englishman visited this region;
yet in the year 1567-8, evidence goes
to prove that one David Ingram, an
Englishman, set ashore with a number
of companions in the Bay of Mexico,
journeyed on foot across the country
to the river St. John, New Brunswick,
and sailed thence for France. Possibly
he was half crazed by his sufferings,
yet there can be little doubt that he
crossed the continent and passed
through the State of New York, traveling
on the Indian paths and crossing
many broad rivers. If the story is
true, Ingram is the first Englishman
known to have visited these parts.</p>

<p>In April, 1583, Captain Carline wrote
out propositions for a voyage “to the
latitude of fortie degrees or thereabouts,
of that hithermost part of America,”
and, in 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert
had this region under consideration,
Hakluyt observing on the margin of
his “Divers Voyages” that this was
“the Countrey of Sir H. G. Uoyage.”
Hays says in his account of the
region, that “God hath reserved the
same to be reduced unto Christian civility
by the English nation” and, also
that “God would raise him up an instrument
to effect the same.” All this
is very interesting in connection with
English claims and enterprise. In the
same year the French were active on
the coast, and one Stephen Bellinger,
of Rouen, sailed to Cape Breton, and
thence coasted southwesterly six hundred
miles “and had trafique with the
people in tenne or twelve places.”
Thus the French were moving from
both the north and the south towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
this central region; but we cannot say
how far south Bellinger actually came,
as there is nothing to indicate his mode
of computation. It is not improbable
that he knew and profited by the rich
fur-trade of the Hudson.</p>

<p>In 1598 and there about, we find it
asserted that the Dutch were upon the
ground, for, in the year 1644, the Committee
of the Dutch West India Company,
known as the General Board of
Accounts, to whom numerous documents
and papers have been intrusted,
made a lengthy report, which they begin
as follows: “New Netherland,
situated in America, between English
Virginia and New England, extending
from the South [Delaware] river, lying
in 34½ degrees to Cape Malabat, in
the latitude of 41½ degrees, was first
frequented by the inhabitants of this
country in the year 1598, and especially
by those of the Greenland Company,
but without making any fixed
settlements, only as a shelter in winter.
For which they built on the North
[Hudson] and the South [Delaware]
rivers there two little forts against the
attacks of the Indians.” Mr. Brodhead
says that the statement “needs confirmation.”
Still it is somewhat easy
to understand why a statement of this
kind coming from such a body should
require confirmation; but the Committee
had no reason for misstating the
facts, and ought to have been accurately
informed. Yet if confirmation is
insisted upon, we are prepared to give
it, such as it is, from an English and,
in fact, an unexpected source. Our
authority is no less a personage than
Governor Bradford, of Plymouth
Colony, whose office and inclinations
led him to challenge all unfounded
claims that might be put forth by the
Dutch. Nevertheless, writing to Sir
Ferdinando Gorges, the father of New
England colonization, who likewise
was hostile to the pretensions of the
Dutch, Bradford says, under date of
June 15, 1627, that the Dutch on the
Hudson “have used trading there this
six-or-seven-and-twenty years, but
have begun to plant of later time, and
now have reduced their trade to some
order.” Bradford lived in Holland in
1608, and had abundant opportunities
for knowing everything relating to
Dutch enterprise. It is perfectly well
known that the Plymouth Colonists of
1620 intended to settle at the Hudson,
though circumstances directed them to
the spot pointed out by Dermer in
1619, when in the service of Gorges.
Thus, about seventeen years before the
Committee of 1644 reported, Governor
Bradford, an unwilling, but every way
competent and candid witness, carried
back the Dutch occupancy, under
the Greenland Company, to the year
1600. Besides, on the English map
of the voyage of Linschoten, 1598,
there is a dotted trail from the latitude
of the Hudson, 40° N. to the St. Lawrence,
showing that the route was one
known and traveled at that time. It
is evident, from a variety of considerations,
that both the Dutch and French
resorted to the Hudson at this period
to engage in the trade. Linschoten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
was one of the best informed of Dutch
writers, and probably understood the
significance of the representation upon
his map. The probability is that this
route was known a long time before,
and that it may be indicated by Cartier,
who, when in Canada, 1534, was
told of a route by the way of the river
Richelieu, to a country a month’s distance
southward, supposed to produce
cinnamon and cloves, which Cartier
thought the route to Florida. Champlain,
writing in Canada, says that, in
the year previous, certain French who
lived on the Hudson were taken prisoners
when out on an expedition
against the northern Indians, and were
liberated, on the ground that they were
friends of the French in Canada. This
agrees with the report of the Labadists,
who taught that a French child,
Jean Vigné, was born here in 1614.
Evidently the French had been on the
ground in force for some years, and
were able to make expeditions against
the savages. Very likely the French
were here quite as early as the Hollanders.</p>

<p>There seems to be, however, another
curious piece of confirmation, which
comes from the writings of the celebrated
Father Isaac Jogues, who was
in New Amsterdam during the year
1646. In a letter written on August
3d of that year, he says that the Dutch
were here, “about fifty years” before,
while they began to settle permanently
only about “twenty years” since.
The latter statement is sufficiently correct,
as 1623 was the year when a
permanent colony was established by
the Dutch. The former statement carries
us back to the date of the “Greenland
Company.”</p>

<p>So far as present evidence goes, it is
perhaps unnecessary to say anything
more in vindication of the statement
of the Dutch Committee of 1644, claiming
that representatives of the Greenland
Company wintered here in 1598.
Nevertheless, as a matter of interest,
and to show how well the Hudson was
known at this time by both Dutch and
English, we may quote from the English
translation of the Dutch narrative
of Linschoten, which clearly describes
the coast. He says: “There is a countrey
under 44 degrees and a halfe,
called Baccalaos.” This country of
Baccalaos reached nine hundred miles,
that is, from the Cape de Baccalaos
[Cape Race] to Florida.</p>

<p>The distances are given approximately,
of course, by Linschoten, being on
the decimal system, but they distinctly
mark the principal divisions of the coast
and fix the fact beyond question that
the Hudson was perfectly well
known.</p>

<p>On the general subject it may be
said, that the record of the “Greenland
Company” is not satisfactory, yet the
word “Greenland” at that time had a
very general use, and all that the Committee
of Accounts may have meant
by the phrase was, that a company or
association engaged in the fur and fish
trade, which for centuries, even, had
been prosecuted at the north, had sent
some ships to this region in 1598.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
There is certainly nothing unreasonable
in this supposition, the coast being
so well known. Various adventurers
of whom we know nothing doubtless
came and went unobserved, being
in no haste to publish the source from
which they derived such a profitable
trade in peltries. The Committee of
Accounts either falsified deliberately or
followed some old tradition. Why may
not a tradition be true?</p>

<p>We turn next to examine a map recently
brought to notice and which is
of unique value. Formerly the map
usually pointed out as the oldest
seventeenth century map of this region
was the Dutch “Figurative” Map,
which was found by Mr. Brodhead in
the Dutch archives. We have now,
however, an earlier map of 1610, which
was prepared from English data for
James I., a copy finding its way to
Philip III., by Velasco, March 22,
1611. Sandy Hook, though without
name, is delineated about as it appears
in later maps, while Long Island is
shown as a part of the main, with no
indication of the Sound, though Cape
Cod and the neighboring islands are
well delineated, and Verrazano’s
Island of “Luisa” appears as
“Cla[u]dia,” the mother of Francis I.
Clearly at this time neither Block nor
any other Dutch navigator had passed
through Hell Gate into Long Island
Sound.</p>

<p>There is nothing whatever in this
map relating to explorations by any
nation later than 1607. Jamestown
appears on the Virginia portion, and
Sagadehoc in Maine. It was simply a
copy of a map made soon after the
voyage to New England and Virginia
in 1607. The compiler had not heard
of Hudson’s voyage, as that navigator
did not reach England until November
7, 1609. If he had received any information
from Hudson, he would have
shown the river terminating in a shallow,
innavigable brook, whereas the
river is indicated, in accordance with
Captain John Smith’s idea, as a strait,
leading to a large body of water.
Further, the map contradicts Hudson,
who represents the Hoboken side of
the river as “Manhatta,” while this
map puts the name on both sides,
“Manahata,” on the west and “Manahatin”
on the east. It is not unlikely
that Hudson had with him a copy
of the map, for his guidance on the
voyage in the Half-Moon.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus11" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus11.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SIR WALTER RALEIGH.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Though this map bears a date subsequent
to Hudson’s voyage, the contents
prove that the original could not
have been drawn later than 1608. It
was evidently one of the various maps
of which Smith spoke and which he
underrated. Its substance indicates
that it was drawn from a source independent
of the Dutch and French,
showing that the English knew of the
Bay of New York and its relation to
Sandy Hook, and that they supposed
the great river delineated was a broad
stream which, in someway, communicated
with the Pacific. On the original
map of which Velasco’s example was
a copy, the land west of the river was
colored blue, and the legend says that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
it is described by information drawn
from the Indians. What we need now
is the original map, which may still
exist in some obscure collection in
England or Holland, and quite as likely
in the archives of Spain, sent thither by
jealous Spanish spies, who lingered,
like Velasco, at the court of James I.,
to learn what they could with respect
to English enterprise in America. At
all events we have in this English map
the first seventeenth century delineation
of this region, and one showing
that the English knew the form and
general character of the country which
the crown conveyed to the colonists of
North and South Virginia in 1606. So
far as now known, it was clearly the
English who first became acquainted
with the name that the Aborigines
applied to the island upon which our
great metropolitan city stands.
Whether or not this was an aboriginal
word or a corruption of a Castilian
term future investigators may decide.
The unexpected finding of this old
English map in the Spanish archives
revives our hopes relating to the discovery
of new sources of information
concerning early voyages to this coast.
English enterprise and adventure on
the Virginia coast, extending from
Raleigh’s expedition, 1584, to Gosnold’s
fatal quest, 1603, must have brought
Englishmen into the Bay of New York,
unless miracle was balanced against
curiosity and chance. There are archives
yet to be opened that may give
the origin of the delineations of this
region found in the remarkable map
from Samancas, and we need to be
cautious in making claims even for the
priority of the Dutch in 1598.</p>

<p>The period under consideration was
a period of reconnoissance, one that
offered some romantic incident, but
more of disappointment and mortification.
Here was a site for one of the
noblest cities in the world, but the
voyager was blind. The river offered
no route to the gorgeous Indies, and
Verrazano had little inclination to test
its swift tide. Gomez, in the short
January days of 1525, had no desire to
ascend, for when his ship met the drift
ice tossing on the cold, swirling stream,
he thought of Anthony in his desolate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
retreat on the Red Sea, put the river
under his charge, and sailed away in
search of happier shores. Sailors of
other nationalities, doubtless, ascended
the river; but, finding it simply a river,
they took what peltries they could get,
and, like Gomez, turned the whole
region over to the care of the solitary
Saint, who for nearly a century stood
connected with its neglect. Much remained
to be done before steps could
be taken with regard to colonization.
The initial work, however, was inaugurated
by the sturdy Englishman,
Henry Hudson, and the proud Spanish
caravel disappears, while the curtain
rises upon the memorable voyage of
the quaint Dutch fly-boat, the Half-Moon.</p>

reader may compare the reconstructed Map
of Chaves with the coast surveys, when the
main difference will be found to consist in
the exaggeration of Sandy Hook. The
“Narrative and Critical History of America,”
dealing with this point, suppresses all
allusion to the fact that Kohl recognizes the
cape on the Map of Chaves with the names
“Santiago” and “Arenas” as Sandy Hook,
which follows, as the river inside of the
Hook he identifies with the Hudson. Dr.
Kohl, though generally very acute, failed to
see that Oviedo’s description of the Map of
Chaves was, substantially, the description
of Ribeiro, and that in identifying, as he
chanced to, the “Arenas” of Ribeiro with
Cape Cod, he stultified his own reasoning.
Nor did he consider this, that if the great
Cape “Arenas” was intended for Cape Cod,
there is no representation whatever of Sandy
Hook and the Hudson in the old cartography
and that all the voyages to this region geographically
went for nothing. <i>Credat Judaeus
Appellus!</i> This exaggeration of Sandy
Hook is conceded, yet the inlets along the
New Jersey shore may have been viewed as
connected by Gomez; and indeed, so great
have been the changes along the coast that
no one can well deny that they were connected
in 1525, and formed a long bay running
down behind Sandy Hook. It will
prove more historic to follow the writer, who
says, “that the coast of New York and the
neighboring district were known to Europeans
almost a century before Hudson ascended
the ‘Great River of the North,’ and
that this knowledge is proved by various
maps made in the course of the sixteenth
century. Nearly all of them place the mouth
of a river between the fortieth and forty-first
degrees of latitude, or what should be this
latitude, but which imperfect instruments
have placed farther north.”—Nar. and Crit.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EARLY_AMERICAN_LITERATURE">EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Seventy-odd years ago the Rev.
Sydney Smith wrote in the Edinburg
Review as follows: “Literature, the
Americans have none—no native literature,
we mean. It is all imported.
They had a Franklin, indeed, and may
afford to live for half a century on his
fame. There is, or was, a Mr. Dwight,
who wrote some poems, and his baptismal
name was Timothy. There is
also a small account of Virginia, by
Jefferson, an epic by Joel Barlow, and
some pieces of pleasantry by Mr. Irving.
But why should the Americans
write books, when a six weeks’ passage
brings them, in their own tongue,
our sense, science and genius in bales
and hogsheads?”</p>

<p>Times have changed since Mr. Smith
wrote this somewhat sarcastic summary
of our native literature; for,
while it is true that we still import
British “sense, science, and genius in
bales and hogsheads,” it is done now
on principles of reciprocity, and we return
quite as good and perhaps nearly
as much as we receive.</p>

<p>Americans do not instance Mr.
Dwight, whose “baptismal name was
Timothy,” or Mr. Barlow, the author
of the epic so sneeringly referred to, as
the chiefs of American poesy; yet we
need not blush for either of them; for
the first was a distinguished scholar
the President of Yale College, and the
author of the hymn so dear to many
pious hearts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I love thy kingdom, Lord!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The house of Thine abode;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The church our blest Redeemer saved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With His own precious blood.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The other, Mr. Barlow, was a well-known
man of letters and politician in
his day, author of the “Columbiad,”
the epic referred to by Mr. Smith, and
minister plenipotentiary of the United
States to the coast of France at a critical
period of our history. As to the
“Columbiad,” it has been pronounced
by competent critics to be equal in
merit to Addison’s “Campaign,” and
surely it is no disgrace to have equalled
Addison.</p>

<p>It was the fashion in those days for
Englishmen to sneer at Americans;
and so we find in another review,
written by the same gentleman in 1820,
this language: “During the thirty or
forty years of their independence, they
have done absolutely nothing for the
sciences, for the arts, for literature,
or even for the statesmanlike studies
of politics or political economy....
In the four quarters of the globe who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
reads an American book? or looks at
an American picture or statue? What
does the world yet owe to American
physicians or surgeons? What new
substances have their chemists discovered?
or what old ones have they
analyzed? What new constellations
have been discovered by the telescopes
of Americans? What have they
done in mathematics? Who drinks
out of American glasses? or eats from
American plates? or wears American
coats or gowns? or sleeps in American
blankets?” In the very same year
that this array of rather insolent
queries was propounded by Sydney
Smith, the genial Washington Irving,
in the advertisement to the first English
edition of his Sketch Book, remarks:
“The author is aware of the
austerity with which the writings of
his countrymen have been treated by
British critics.” We have not a particle
of doubt as to the “austerity” in
question. The salvos of Old Ironsides
and the roar of Jackson’s guns at New
Orleans, were unpleasant facts not yet
forgotten by Englishmen.</p>

<p>But Sydney Smith was not quite fair
towards our countrymen. It was “during
the thirty or forty years of their
independence” referred to that Fulton’s
steamboat revolutionized navigation,
that Rittenhouse developed a mathematical
skill second only to that of
Newton; that West delighted even
royalty itself with the creations of his
pencil; while in “the statesmanlike
studies of politics or political economy,”
it was during this very period
that Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison,
and their coadjutors did more to develop
the true principles of government
and politics than had ever been done
before in the history of the world.
True, we had not much to boast of,
but it would have been only just to
give us credit for what we were worth.
Moreover, in a small way, but to the
extent it was possible under the circumstances,
the English colonists in
America had cultivated letters from the
beginning. In 1685, Cotton Mather
wrote his Memorable Providences; in
1732, Franklin began to issue his Poor
Richard’s Almanac; in 1749, Jonathan
Edwards published his Life of David
Brainerd, and in 1754, his famous
treatise on The Freedom of the Will
and Moral Agency. Besides these,
which perhaps stand out most conspicuously,
there were many minor
works of more or less excellence, over
most of which the iniquity of oblivion,
to use the fine phrase of Sir Thomas
Browne, hath scattered her poppy.</p>

<p>The moment that the Edinburg Review
was thus dealing our fathers these
heavy blows seemed to be the real
starting point in our career of literary
greatness. William Cullen Bryant,
Washington Irving, James K. Paulding,
Richard H. Dana, James Fenimore
Cooper, Mrs. Sigourney and a
host of others were giving direction to
that stream of literature that has since
flowed broad and free over our land,
imparting life and vigor and beauty
to our society and institutions. It is,
however, anterior to the year 1820, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
thirty or forty years of our national
independence, during which Mr. Smith
says we have done “absolutely nothing”
in literature, science or art, to
which we must more particularly advert.
The literary product of those
years was scanty enough, it is true.
The student of this period will not find
much, and not all of that of the first
order, to reward his labor—not much,
at least, as compared with other nations
at the same time. But may there
not have been some sufficient reason
for this, outside of any downright intellectual
deficiencies on the part of
our fathers? Let us for a moment
consider the condition of things at
that time in this country.</p>

<p>In the first place, at the time referred
to, the citizens of the United States
were in a daily struggle with the
material difficulties of their situation.
The country was new. The region
west and north of the Ohio and Mississippi
was yet an almost unbroken
wilderness, while the country east
and south of those rivers was but
sparsely populated. At the same time
the tide of immigration was sweeping
into the country, and with it all the
rush and turmoil incident to life in a
new country was going on. Forests
were to be cut down; farms were to
be cleared up; houses were to be built;
roads were to be made; bridges were
to be thrown across the rivers; while
a livelihood was to be compelled from
the forests, the streams, and the fields.
The conditions of a new country are
not favorable to the cultivation of the
arts, of sciences, or of literature.
Why do not Englishmen twit the
people of Australia because during
the past forty or fifty years in which
they have prospered so greatly in
material things, they have not produced
a Macaulay, a Tennyson, a
Gladstone, a Tyndall, or a Huxley?
It would be just as fair to do it.</p>

<p>Not only was there this hand to
hand contest with their physical environment,
but the political conditions
were also unfavorable to any general
dalliance with the Muses. Only in
times of tranquility and ease is it possible.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Or with the tangles of Neaera’s hair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The country at the period referred
to, had just emerged from a long and
exhausting war. Society was almost
broken up; the arts of peace were
well nigh forgotten; the finances were
in almost hopeless confusion; the
form of government was unsettled,
and scarcely yet determined upon.
The first thing to do was to evolve
some system and some security out
of this chaos. Politics alone occupied
the moments of leisure. When,
finally, authority had crystallized
into definite government the
people were not allowed to be
at rest. Murderous wars with the Indians
on the frontiers; the machinations
of French emissaries; British
oppression of American commerce,
and at length another long and bloody
war with England, harassed the minds
of the people, and prevented them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
from giving themselves up more generally
to the kindly and refining influences
of literature and art. When
we consider all the circumstances in
the case, there seems a degree of
severity in Sydney Smith’s sneers and
taunts.</p>

<p>But though circumstances were thus
unfavorable to the cultivation of letters,
yet something was done in this
direction nevertheless. Smith refers
flippantly enough to Dwight, Jefferson,
Barlow and Irving. But besides
these there were others, not brilliant
luminaries perhaps, yet stars shining
in the darkness according to their
orders and degrees. We do not design
here to enter upon any discussion of
their respective merits, but we may
mention as a writer of that period no
less a character than George Washington,
whose greatness in other spheres
of life has entirely eclipsed any fame
of which he may be worthy as an
author, yet whose Farewell Address
alone would entitle him to a place
among the most accurate writers of
English. Among others we may
name John Adams, whose pen was
scarcely less eloquent than his tongue;
Francis Hopkinson, author of The
Battle of the Kegs and many other
pieces, of which it has been said, that
“while they are fully equal to any of
Swift’s writings for wit, they have
nothing at all in them of Swift’s vulgarity;”
Dr. Benjamin Rush, a distinguished
writer on medical and social
topics; John Trumbull, the
author of McFingal and The Progress
of Dullness; James Madison, afterward
President of the United States,
one of the ablest writers in The Federalist;
Philip Freneau, a poet of the
Revolution and the period immediately
following; Alexander Hamilton, a
contributor to The Federalist, and one
of the clearest of political writers;
Joseph Dennie, the author of The Lay
Preacher, and editor of The Portfolio;
Joseph Hopkinson, author of Hail,
Columbia; Charles Brockden Brown,
author of Wieland, Arthur Mervyn,
and other works, and who was perhaps
the first American who wholly
devoted his life to literary pursuits;
William Wirt, author of the British
Spy, the Life of Patrick Henry, and
other works; and Lyman Beecher,
the author of a work on Political
Atheism, anti several volumes of sermons
and public addresses. This list
might easily be extended, but its
length as it now stands, as well as the
merits of the writers adduced, is sufficient
to contradict effectually the
statement that America had “no native
literature,” and that during the
thirty or forty years immediately subsequent
to the Revolution she had
done “absolutely nothing” for polite
letters. Much of this early literature
still remains, and is read; many of
these authors are still familiar to this
generation, and it is generally admitted
that the writer whose fame survives
a century is assured of a literary
immortality. Sydney Smith was an
acute man, a learned man, a great wit,
a ready and elegant writer, a trenchant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
critic, but the names of some
of these humble Americans whom he
did not deign to mention, or mentioned
only to scoff, bid fair to stand
as long in the annals of literature as
his own.</p>

<p>On the eastern slope of the Andes
are a thousand springs from which
the slender rills, half hidden at times
by the grass, scarcely at any time
seen or heard, trickle down the side
of the immense mountain range, here
and there falling into each other and
swelling in volume as they flow, until
at length is formed the mighty Amazon,
that drains the plateaus and valleys
of half a continent. So the
beginnings of our literature, like the
beginnings of every literature, are
small, indistinct, half hidden; but as
they proceed, these little rills of
thought and expression grow and expand,
until the mighty stream is
formed that irrigates the whole world
of intellectual activity.</p>

<p>This stream, as we have said, first
began to assume definite form and
direction about the time that Sydney
Smith was uttering his tirades against
the genius and achievements of our
countrymen. In 1817, appeared in
the North American Review a remarkable
poem called “Thanatopsis.” The
author was a young man named William
Cullen Bryant, only twenty-three
years of age; yet the poem had been
written four years before. The annals
of literature do not furnish another example
of such excellence at so early
an age. The poem yet stands as one
of the most exquisite in the language.
A recent critic has characterized it as
“lofty in conception, beautiful in execution,
full of chaste language and delicate
and striking imagery, and, above
all, pervaded by a noble and cheerful
religious philosophy.” This first effort
on the part of Bryant was succeeded
by a long career of eminence in the
field of literature. In 1818 appeared a
volume of miscellanies called “The
Sketch Book,” by Washington Irving, a
young man who had already acquired
some slight reputation as a dabbler in
literature of a trifling or humorous
kind. The Sketch Book was almost
immediately honored by republication
in England. This initial volume was
followed by a second series of miscellanies
called “Bracebridge Hall,”
which was published in London in
1822. In the preliminary chapter the
author pleasantly adverts to the general
feeling with which American authorship
was regarded in England. “It
has been a matter of marvel to my
European readers,” says he, “that a
man from the wilds of America should
express himself in tolerable English.
I was looked upon as something new
and strange in literature; a kind of
demi-savage, with a feather in his hand
instead of on his head; and there was
a curiosity to hear what such a being
had to say about civilized society.” In
the same year with Irving’s Sketch
Book appeared Drake’s Culprit Fay, a
poem that has not been surpassed in
its kind since Milton’s Comus. In 1821
Percival issued his first volume of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
poems, Dana his Idle Man, and
Cooper, his Precaution. His last
named volume was at once followed
by a long list of works including such
famous titles as The Spy, The Last of
the Mohicans, The Pathfinder, and The
Deerslayer. It marked the advent of
our most distinguished novelist—a
man who has been styled the Walter
Scott of America. He justly stands in
the same rank with the mighty Wizard
of the North, and has no other equal.
Thus the stream of American literature
rolled on its course, and was swelled
as it flowed by the contributions of
Everett, Prescott, Bancroft, Emerson,
Hawthorne, Poe, Willis, Holmes, Whittier,
Lowell, and a host of others,
whose names the world will not willingly
let die.</p>

<p>America has not yet produced a
Shakespere or a Milton; but it must
be remembered that England has produced
but one, each of these in a period
of a thousand years. Anywhere
below these two great names, American
literature of the last seventy years
is able to parallel the best work that
has been produced by our kinsmen on
the other side of the Atlantic. In
wealth and elegance of diction, in
depth of thought or feeling, in brightness
and grace of expression, in any of
the thousand forms and flights in which
genius seeks to express himself, the
current literature of America stands on
a level with the current literature of
England; and Sydney Smith’s sneers,
which must have touched our fathers
to the quick, find no response now except
the smile of contempt which alone
they ever deserved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_OHIO_SOCIETY_AND_OHIO_IN_NEW_YORK">THE OHIO SOCIETY, AND OHIO IN NEW YORK.<br>
<span class="smaller">I.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There are many things that link the
capital city of financial and commercial
America, to the State of Ohio,
that New England enterprise, and
New York encouragement, and Virginian
patriotism, did so much to
build beyond the Alleghenies. It is
not merely in the associations and
connections of to-day that New York
and Ohio are bound together. A pregnant
era of the early past, was disposed
toward good results forever, by
the patriotic generosity of the Empire
State, at a time when Ohio was but a
name in the far off wilderness; a
promise that many things must nurture,
before it could be realized.</p>

<p>Historians will recall, when this
much has been said, the events that
were pressed close upon each other,
before the soil upon which Ohio now
stands, was declared the property of
the nation, disentangled from the conflicting
claims of jealous States, and
how New York by her self-renunciation,
led the way to harmony. For a
century had Virginia and Connecticut
made their claims to the vast westward
territory; vaster than the imagination
of any living man then conceived.
When the French were driven
from the lands west of the bounds of
Pennsylvania, the contention commenced,
and claims were urged from
time to time, until both voices of dispute
were temporarily silenced by the war
in which the rivals fought side by
side for the freedom of both. When
that conflict was ended, the question
again arose; not, this time, with the
English Crown as the greater power,
but with the loose jointed Confederation,
under which America endeavored
to work out a national salvation. Virginia,
made her demand under the
grant of James, in 1609, which gave
her: “All those lands, countries and
territories, situated, lying, and being in
that part of America called Virginia,
from the point of the eastern land
called Cape or Point Comfort, all that
space and circuit of land lying, from
the seacoast of the precinct aforesaid,
up into the land, throughout, from sea
to sea, west and northwest, and also
all the islands lying within one hundred
miles along the coast of the both
seas of the precinct aforesaid.”</p>

<p>This generous King, who was giving
away so much that did not belong to
him, was really giving more than
he dreamed of; for the writer of the
grant evidently believed that the
South Sea, or Pacific Ocean, was but
little westward of the Atlantic, and
never dreamed that he was extending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
his line so as to take in the magnificent
Western and Northwestern
empire of to-day.</p>

<p>Connecticut made her claim under
Charles the II, who in 1662, gave to
the colony “All that part of our
dominion in New England, in America,
bounded on the east by the Narragansett
River, commonly called
Narragansett Bay, where the said
river falleth into the sea, and on the
north by the line of the Massachusetts
plantation, and on the south by the
sea, and in longitude as the line of the
Massachusetts colony, running from
east to west; that is to say, from the
said Narragansett Bay, on the east to
the South Sea on the west part, with
the islands thereto adjoining.”</p>

<p>It was under this very vague, but
very extensive grant, that Connecticut
laid claim to, and maintained that
claim, for that part of Ohio known the
world over, as the “Connecticut
Western Reserve.”</p>

<p>While Virginia, Connecticut and
Pennsylvania were warring in the
courts, in the legislatures, and before
the people over their various claims,
there were many others who virtually
assumed that the whole unoccupied
and unorganized land to the west, belonged
to the nation at large, and that
no state had a right to exclusive jurisdiction.
This discussion threatened
all sorts of difficulties, at a time when
peace and prosperity could only come
through a mutual helpfulness and internal
harmony, and the wisest and most
patriotic declared themselves willing to
waive all personal claims, and allow
the national government to administer
the general estate for the general good.
Congress so viewed it, and appealed to
the States to yield their claims. The
first response came from New York,
which conceded all her possible
ownership to western territory, to the
general government, and the other
States followed in her wake. Virginia
followed New York; and Massachusetts
Virginia; and eventually Connecticut
came into line.</p>

<p>In the appeal of Congress to the
States there was no ambiguity as to the
purpose to which these lands were to
be devoted. The act of October 10,
1780, resolved that “the unappropriated
lands that may be ceded or relinquished
to the United States by any
particular State,” should be disposed
of “for the common benefit of the
United States, and shall be settled and
formed into distinct republican States,
which shall become members of the
Federal Union, and have the same
right of sovereignty, freedom and independence
as the other States; that
each which shall be so formed shall
contain a suitable extent of territory
not less than one hundred nor more
than one hundred and fifty miles
square, or as near thereto as circumstances
will admit, that the necessary
and reasonable expense which any particular
State shall have incurred since
the commencement of the present war,
in subduing any part of the territory
that may be ceded or relinquished to
the United States, shall be reimbursed.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
It was further agreed that said lands
should be “granted or settled at such
times and under such regulations” as
should be thereafter agreed upon by
the United States, or any nine or more
of them.</p>

<p>In less than six months after the issuing
of this broad invitation, New
York set an example of generosity to
her young sister States, which had so
much yet to learn in the way of mutual
concessions for the general good. And
she made no conditions in her surrender.
She simply said that she would
draw a line across the western end of
Lake Ontario, north and south, and
that while all east of it should be hers,
all west would be forever quit-claimed
to the nation. It took Virginia three
years to make up her mind, and when
she waived her claim in March, 1784,
she yet reserved nearly four million
acres to the south and east of the Ohio.
The year following, Massachusetts
came in with no conditions, while
Connecticut followed, in the fall of
1786, conditioning that she should retain
the magnificent Western Reserve,
upon which a New Connecticut was
eventually built in the wilderness—that
Reserve that has played so important
a part in the history, and the moral
development of the republic. South
Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia,
at last straggled, one by one, into the
path of manifest destiny; although the
century had turned the point of time by
two notches, before the last hand was
lessened, and the Nation became in
law what she had already been in fact—the
architect and master of the
splendid empire that stretched from
the western edge of the civilization of
that day, to where the Spaniard and
the Frenchman still held a nominal
right to the westward of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>With these cessions, the territorial
system of our government came into
existence. That which Georgia gave,
became the Mississippi Territory; that
from the Carolinas, the Southwest Territory;
and all that north of the Ohio
River, the Northwest Territory; and
this brings us to a point where New
York again had a part in creating the
State of Ohio, and in dedicating the
soil upon which she was reared, forever
to the cause of human liberty.</p>

<p>It was within the limits of her chief
city that the very foundation stones,
not only of the one State but of many,
were laid with a far-seeing wisdom
and prophetic foresight that mark the
men of that early Congress as among
the sages of legislative wisdom. In
the old hall, that stood at the corner of
Wall and Broad streets, where the restless
oceans of a financial world roll in
a flood that never rests, and to which
the lines of monetary interest center
from all the far-off corners of the land,
upon the spot now hallowed to the
memory of Washington by a colossal
statue of bronze, there was enacted, in
the midsummer of 1787, an ordinance
that has well been called<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
most important legislative act in
American History”—there came into
existence a law that gave Ohio and
Indiana, and that galaxy of northwestern
states to the Union; those free
states, without which that Union never
could have been saved in the day of
its imminent peril.</p>

<p>Many States have been created,
many important acts have been passed
by the various Congresses that have
sat in New York, in Philadelphia, and
in Washington, but there was in this
measure something that saved the
nation from being sometime all slave;
that reserved for freedom an empire
that by mere stress of moral example if
in nothing else, was a menace forever
before the slaveholder. In that ordinance
was one little clause that made
Ohio and Wisconsin and Illinois what
they afterwards became.</p>

<p>“There shall be,” it recited, “neither
slavery, nor involuntary servitude in
said territory, otherwise than in the
punishment of crimes.” Simple enough
these words sound now, when human
bondage upon American soil is but the
echo of a dead past, but for the day in
which they were uttered, they were the
clarion call of a new era—the death
knell of a monster wrong; and the
voice was none the less that of God
speaking in human legislation, because
many of the men who had become His
instrument, had no dream of the great
things to which they had put their
hands, and to which they had given
their votes.</p>

<p>So, in one sense, Ohio may be said
to have had her beginning in New
York. From the days of her earliest
childhood, she has been a willing
neighbor, willing to give and take of
friendly offices with her elder sister to
the East. Two of her chief magistrates
were the sons of the Empire
State; she has borrowed not a little of
her legislation from the experience of
the older State; she patterned her canals
after those which DeWitt Clinton had
so largely aided to bring into being;
she has developed many of her native
resources by New York’s financial aid;
she has sought to build her railways so
that they should lead direct to the metropolis;
she has in a thousand ways acknowledged
the commercial and financial
supremacy of the greater city and
State; and last, but not the least, she
has sent scores of her sons to the East,
to prove that the Buckeye is capable of
gaining and holding his own among
the best, in any lines of human labor
or human thought—and it is with this
subject largely, that we have at present
to deal.</p>

<p>There hangs in certain cheerful
rooms at No. 236 Fifth avenue, a
modestly framed document that is
more significant in that which it suggests,
than in what it declares. It is
a call for a meeting, and a pledge of
certain gentlemen whose names are
attached, that they will do what lies
within their power to create in this
great metropolis, a hearthstone around
which those who claimed Ohio for a
mother or a foster-mother, might
congregate now and then, for such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
mutual help or association as would
keep the memory of the old home
alive in the new. The beginning was
modest and quiet, and yet out of it
has grown an organization that is in
many ways a model of its kind, and
that certainly has fulfilled the intentions
of its originators.</p>

<p>“We the undersigned,” to quote
from the language of the call, “hereby
agree to unite with each to form an
association to be known as The Ohio
Association in New York, and to that
end will meet at any place designated,
for the purpose of completing such
organization upon notice given to us
whenever twelve persons shall have
signed this agreement. There is to be
no expense incurred until the organization
is completed, and assented to by
each member.”</p>

<p>“New York, October 7th, 1885.”</p>

<p>Attached to this document were
names that would have carried weight
in many of the walks of the business
and professional life of the metropolis.
General Thomas Ewing, an honored
member of the New York Bar, Samuel
Thomas and Calvin S. Brice, of the
more active fields of Wall Street and
the railway world, C. W. Moulton, Col.
W. L. Strong, one of the leading
merchants of the city, Hugh J. Jewett,
Wallace C. Andrews, Homer Lee, J.
W. Harman, Warren Higley, Milton
Sayler, Anson G. McCook, Col. Fogg,
Mahlon Chance, J. Q. Howard, General
Henry L. Burnett, and others who
had acquired reputation at home,
before making New York the scene of
later operations and more recent successes.
There was more than mere
formal agreement in this compact; it
was understood by all that such a
society should come into being, and
all were in one mind that then was the
time for beginning.</p>

<p>Other attempts looking in the same
direction had been made in times
past, but had come to naught. Early
in the days of the great war, many of
the sons and daughters of Ohio, residing
in this city, met at the Murray
Hill Hotel, and took steps to give
active aid to the soldiers in the field;
but these weekly gatherings ended
with the noble purpose that called
them into being. In the first annual
report of the Ohio Society, its first
secretary, Homer Lee, gives a brief
sketch of this effort, and of the things
that followed in its wake. “The object,”
says Mr. Lee, “was to
send supplies, clothing, medicines,
etc., to the soldiers at the front.
A handsome silk and satin banner
was made at a cost of some
$500, upon which was a beautifully
embroidered Coat of Arms of the State
of Ohio, to be presented to the bravest
Ohio regiment. As might have been
expected there was much rivalry for
the possession of this prize, as glowing
descriptions of the beautiful
souvenir were given by the newspapers
at that time. The commanding
officers were appealed to, but could
not be prevailed upon to decide the
question, because, as one officer put it
‘It could not easily be decided which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
was the bravest, where all the regiments
by their valor and heroism had
covered themselves with glory.’ At
the close of the war the 7th Ohio
Volunteer Infantry, of Cleveland,
secured the prize.”</p>

<p>Another organization, somewhat
similar in character and purpose, was
called into being about the same time.
It was the Ohio Soldier’s Aid Society,
and Theron R. Butler, was its president,
and Mr. John R. Cecil the
treasurer. Its members made it their
duty to call upon the Ohio soldiers in
the New York hospitals, and to minister
to their wants. In various forms
of help, this society expended over
fifteen thousand dollars, and performed
many eminent services for the
wounded and the sick, and like its
companion organization above described,
its days ended with the close
of the war.</p>

<p>In 1877, the subject of an association
of Ohio men was again discussed,
when a number of gentlemen had
been called together by the death of
Chief Justice Chase, but it came to
naught. Again, in 1874, some of the
younger sons of the Buckeye State in
this city, held various meetings and
talked organization, but nothing came
of the movement beyond talk. It was
reserved for the call above quoted to
produce enduring results, and to bring
into being the flourishing society that
has bound the Ohioans of New York
together with bonds of enduring
union.</p>

<p>When the twelve, and more, had
signed the call and thus made it
operative, a meeting was held in the
office of General Ewing, No. 155
Broadway, on November 13, 1885.
There was then no question of success,
and the gentlemen present went to
work in a mood to make that success
of the most pronounced character.
General Ewing was elected president
pro tem., and Mr. David F. Harbaugh
secretary pro tem. A committee of
ten upon permanent organization were
appointed, and consisted of the following
gentlemen: C. W. Moulton,
William Perry Fogg, Cyrus Butler,
J. Q. Howard, Mahlon Chance, M. I.
Southard, David F. Harbaugh, Warren
Higley, Calvin S. Brice, and Joseph
Pool. When an adjourned meeting
was held, on the 20th of the same
month, additions were made to this
foundation committee, in the persons
of Messrs. Carson Lake, John W. Harman,
and Homer Lee.</p>

<p>The committee were already prepared
with a report. They had drafted
a provisional constitution, and prepared
by-laws, and proposed that these
should be printed and sent to the
Ohio men in New York, to discover
how many would favor the movement,
and agree to support it. Such action
was ordered, the new fundamental
law of a society not yet organized
was sent broadcast, and responses
invited. One hundred subscribing
names were made the requisite; they
were furnished, and twenty-five in
addition. Thus encouraged, there
was a call from the President, and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the evening of January 13, 1886, over
one hundred of the sons of Ohio were
found together in the parlors of the
Fifth Avenue Hotel.</p>

<p>The meeting was prolific of results.
The Ohio Society of New York, was
called into being. Officers were
elected; arrangements made for the
preparation of a constitution that would
be in exact accord with the purposes
there declared. The first officers there
chosen constituted a corps which was
of itself a guarantee of successful results.
General Thomas Ewing was
elected president; Whitelaw Reid,
General Wager Swayne, Col. William
L. Strong, Hon. Hugh J. Jewett, and
Algernon S. Sullivan were chosen vice-presidents.
Homer Lee was made recording
secretary and Carson Lake, corresponding
secretary; while Col. William
Perry Fogg was assigned to the responsible
position of treasurer. A governing
committee consisting of Henry L.
Burnett, chairman, Calvin S. Brice,
Andrew J. C. Foye, A. D. Juilliard,
George Follett, Stephen B. Elkins,
Jerome D. Gillett, C. W. Moulton,
Joseph Pool, were selected. The president
and vice-president were directed
to prepare the constitution; the invitations
of certain hotels managed by
Ohio men to use their parlors for gatherings
until permanent quarters could
be secured, were accepted; and the
president-elect delivered a striking
address upon assuming office, that
throws so strong a light upon the purpose
and spirit of the gathering, that
the writer is tempted to quote somewhat
freely therefrom.</p>

<p>“We have met to-night” said
General Ewing, “as sons and foster
sons of Ohio resident in New York City
to complete the foundation of a new
society in our National Metropolis.
Full as this city is of organizations of
men, she has, I think, none such as
this. The ties of religion, charity,
politics, science, art, literature and
common occupation draw and hold
people together in numberless associations
which have filled Manhattan
Island with splendid edifices. So,
too, the sympathies of a common race
and history have founded Societies of
St. Patrick, St. Andrew, St. George and
many others, at whose annual reunion,
the wit, song and sentiment of the
fatherlands warm the hearts of their
sons in this land beyond the sea. And
here, also, is an American society
which has at several crises in the last
fifty years exerted a considerable influence
on public opinion, and the annual
reunions of which are watched with
eagerness everywhere throughout our
land where the sons of New England,
from their distant homes, look proudly
and fondly back on their grand old
mother.</p>

<p>“But the New England Society is
composed of the sons of six States. This
is a society of the natives or former
residents of a single State—Ohio, the
State first born of the American Republic.
I do not say she was the first received
into the Union, for Vermont,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Kentucky and Tennessee all preceded
her. Vermont was admitted in 1791,
Kentucky in ’92, Tennessee in ’96 and
Ohio not until the 29th day of November,
1802. But these three older States
begun life as Colonies of Colonies, each
exclusively owned by and settled from
its parent colony—Vermont from New
York, Kentucky from Virginia, and
Tennessee from North Carolina. ‘The
territory northwest of the Ohio river’
was the first land ever owned by the
United States. It was a vast and
pathless wilderness—an Empire in
embryo—when, in 1784, Virginia, with
magnificent generosity, presented it to
the Union. It was not until ten years
later, when the savages, who had been
allies of Great Britain throughout the
War of the Revolution, were routed and
subdued by Mad Anthony Wayne, that
agricultural settlements, except under
the shadow of block-houses, first became
possible. Then the veteran
soldiers of the Revolution, broken in
fortune, but aflame with the love of
liberty and triumphant from the long
struggle for independence, flocked there
from every one of the glorious thirteen;
hewed out homes in the primeval
forest, paid for lands in the long-dishonored
certificates of indebtedness
given for their service in the Revolutionary
War, and thus founded the
first State which sprung from the womb
of the Republic.</p>

<p>“We are proud of Ohio,” continued
the General, “for her heroic birth, her
honorable achievements, and her
glorious destiny. She ‘sits in the centre,’
belongs to no section, and is a
bond of all. Her sons who meet here
to-night are at home in New York. We
do not come together as strangers in
a strange land to seek relief from the
depression of inhospitable influence.
No; New York is not inhospitable.
She is merely too big and too busy to
note who comes or goes. Her gates
landward and seaward, are thrown
open to the world. She is a focus of
all the great forces of American life.
Much that is best and worst in it is
developed here; and the struggle of a
new comer for a footing is always severe,
and generally unsuccessful. But
New York is more truly cosmopolitan
than any other city in the United
States, or, perhaps, in the world; and
there is little of race or sectional prejudice
to bar the path of merit from
whatever quarter it may come.</p>

<p>“We found this Society because we
love Ohio, and would cherish her history,
her traditions, her recollections
of home and camp and forum. How
often do we look back to the days and
scenes of our life there to revive the
sweetest influence and the dearest
memories of existence.</p>

<p>“But we have aims for our Society
beyond the culture of the memories and
affections of other days. We hope to
make it felt in this great field of thought
and action as a generator of wholesome
intellectual and moral forces.
When this meeting was called for permanent
organization there were one
hundred and fifteen signers of our Constitution.
Under the direction of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
judicious Governing Committee, the
number will doubtless be increased to
several hundred. Our membership of
non-residents will perhaps be equally
large. We should make something
more of such good and abundant
material than a mere social club. I
am far from insensible to the pleasures
of convivial reunions, and hope our
society may have many of them, and
that I may long be of the number
present. But we can have some good
work out of it as well as plenty of
recreation. For instance, with the aid
of our western and southwestern
brethern, who, like ourselves, have
drifted into this fence corner of the
Republic, we might help it to throw off
its colonial subserviency to English
politics and manners, and gradually
Americanize it. We can thus repay in
kind the debt of gratitude we owe the
East for its missionary efforts a generation
ago, when it was the seat of power
in the Union, and the now imperial
West was but a half subdued wilderness.</p>

<p>“Ere long we can command means,
I hope, to fit up and maintain an accessible,
commodious and permanent
club house, the halls of which will be
a pleasant rendezvous for members
and their friends, where the ideas and
policies of East and West may meet
in intelligent and friendly encounter,
and where sectional prejudice may be
worn off in the attrition of social intercourse;
where we may see files of the
Ohio newspapers, and note the current
of life at our old homes; where our
brethern who come East may meet,
or learn where to find their friends,
and get information and help in their
business; where Ohio men and women
who are eminent or rising in any
worthy field of effort may have cordial
recognition and a helping hand, if
needed; and where those who have
unfortunately fallen in the struggle for
a foothold here will not be forgotten.
In conclusion, gentlemen, I venture to
express the hope that our Society may
be from the outset, and continue to the
end, so aristocratic that wealth can not
buy a membership for vice, and so
democratic that none will be excluded
by needless cost of membership from
an association which their virtues and
talents would adorn.”</p>

<p>The foundation was thus laid; the
story of the superstructure will be deferred
for the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Thomas Ewing—First President of the Ohio Society.</span></h3>

<p>The connection of General Thomas
Ewing with the founding of the Ohio
Society of New York has been already
shown. At this point some mention
may profitably be made of the chief
points in his public and professional
career; as others of the same Buckeye
group will be considered from time to
time.</p>

<p>General Ewing came into the busy
life of the world at a time, and under
auspices, calculated not only to develop
the best that was in him, but to
call into active play the strongest elements
of his nature. Ohio was in its
youthful days; schools and culture had
not yet reached that point where a
finished education was the rule and
expectation of the great mass of the
youth as now. The freedom of pioneer
life was around him, and while he
learned the lessons of refinement and
culture within his parental home, he
was learning the lessons of self-reliance,
courage and personal responsibility,
from the outdoor environments
of his day and neighborhood.</p>

<p>It was, also, a time when the great
public questions of the day were
debated from the stump, in the home
circle, and at the caucus, and not left
to the newspapers as at present. The
young man was not merely a reader—he
was compelled to think, and often
talk for himself. He must know something
of public life, and he usually had
a personal acquaintance with the public
men of his day and neighborhood.
In the case of General Ewing, one of
the chief men of Ohio history was a
member of his own household—his
father, Thomas Ewing, the Senator
from Ohio, and Secretary of the Treasury
in the cabinets of the elder Harrison
and Tyler, and Secretary of the Interior
under Taylor.</p>

<p>Thomas Ewing, the son, was born
at Lancaster, Ohio, August 7, 1829.
Not only was he the natural heir to the
qualities that had made his father one
of the great statesmen and lawyers of
his day, but he could find back among
the family names that of Findley Ewing,
who distinguished himself under
William of Orange, in the famous war
of 1688, and was presented with a flag
by that monarch, for gallant service at
the siege of Londonderry; George
Ewing, his grandfather, an ensign and
lieutenant of the Revolutionary War;
Neil Gillespie—a man of mark, in the
early days of the Monongahela, and
great-grandfather to James G. Blaine
and himself; and his mother’s father,
Hugh Boyle, who, in youth was driven
from Ireland because of the part he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
had taken in the Emmet rebellion, and
afterward served the State of Ohio for
forty years, as clerk of the Supreme
Court for Fairfield county.</p>

<p>The public life of young Ewing
commenced at an early age. When but
nineteen, he was appointed secretary
of the commission to settle the still
vexed question as to whether the
boundary between Virginia and Ohio
was the high water mark or the low
water mark, on the north side of the
Ohio River. A year later, he became
one of the private secretaries of President
Taylor, and after Taylor’s sudden
death, entered Brown University at
Providence, Rhode Island, from which
he was graduated in 1854.</p>

<p>He had already chosen the profession
of the law, as the work of his life, and
immediately entered the Cincinnati
Law School, from which he was
graduated in 1855. The next year he
married Ellen E. Cox, a daughter of
Rev. Wm. Cox, a Presbyterian minister
of Piqua, Ohio, celebrated for his
eloquence and zeal, and in the fall of
’56 removed to Leavenworth, Kansas,
which he had chosen as the opening
point of his professional career. His
partners in the first firm whose sign-board
bore his name, were two gentlemen
afterwards to win great distinction
in a war then farther off in the minds
of men than in the dread certainties of
fact—General Dan McCook, who afterwards
fell at Kenesaw, and William
T. Sherman, whose recent death the
world is yet lamenting. The name of
the firm was Sherman, Ewing &amp;
McCook.</p>

<p>The success of Mr. Ewing was brilliant
from the start. He had not only
the magnetic presence by which friends
are made, but the “natural genius for
law” that made him a safe counsellor,
a brilliant pleader, and a wary contestant
in the varied fields of litigation.
He was soon one of the recognized
leaders of the bar of Kansas, and it
was inevitable that he should soon be
called to a commanding place in the
field of politics as well. It was a time
and place where no man could be
silent, and when the most sluggish was
compelled to become partisan. The
young advocate from Ohio left no one
in doubt as to which side he took in the
struggle to make Kansas a free State.
He bore an active and conspicuous part
in the struggle on the side of freedom,
and was one of the Republican leaders
of the West. He represented Kansas
in the Peace Conference, which assembled
in Washington on the call of
Virginia in 1860, and at the early age
of twenty-nine was elected the first
chief justice of the Supreme Court of
his State—a position he ably held for
two years, until the great rebellion
swept him from the bench into the
ranks of the Union army.</p>

<p>Some more detailed mention of General
Ewing’s part in that great historic
struggle to make Kansas a free State
is needed, to fully explain the public
service he rendered in those days of
danger. In the fall of 1857, the Pro-Slavery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
constitutional convention of
Kansas, formed the Lecompton constitution,
of which only the slavery
cause was submitted to popular vote.
The question thus left to the people
was whether they would accept a
fundamental law with slavery, or
without. Thus the voter was compelled
to favor the Lecompton constitution if
he voted at all—a constitution hateful
to the Free State majority, as it had
been framed by a fraudulently chosen
convention, composed largely of residents
of Missouri.</p>

<p>It was also provided in this document,
that if the majority voted for it
and rejected slavery, then the slaves
already held in Kansas, should remain
such for life.</p>

<p>At the same election, a separate
vote was ordered for legislative and
executive officers under the constitution.
The hope of the pro slavery party
was that the Free State men, who
were in a great majority in the
territory, would refuse to vote at all,
because of their indignation at the
tricky manner of the submission, and
that therefore, the Democratic Congress
would admit Kansas as a slave State
completely officered by pro slavery
men.</p>

<p>“It was an artful trap,” says one
historian of those stirring times, “and
the Free State Convention was caught
in it by resolving that the party would
wholly refrain from voting at that
election. Thereupon Mr. Ewing bolted
the convention, but only eight out of
over a hundred delegates followed him.
The bolters nominated a full State
ticket and tickets in every county for
all the offices, canvassed the Territory,
and in spite of the bitterest opposition
of the radical leaders and press, succeeded
in bringing a large majority of
the Free State party to the polls. They
thus completely officered the proposed
pro-slavery Government with tried and
true Free State men—publicly pledged,
if the State should be admitted, to
immediately call another convention,
form a Free State Constitution, and
destroy the Lecompton Constitution
and Government, root and branch.
The pro-slavery leaders, finding themselves
outnumbered at the polls, resorted
to the most enormous and
astounding frauds in the returns, and
then officially proclaimed the election
of the pro-slavery candidates. Thereupon
Ewing went to the Territorial
Legislature then in session at Lawrence,
a majority of which were Free
State men, and got a commission
appointed to investigate and expose
the election frauds. He was a member
of the Board and conducted its proceedings
with startling boldness and
energy, resulting within a week in the
discovery and seizure of the forged
returns, which had been buried in a
candle box under a wood pile at Lecompton
on the premises of the United
States Surveyor General, John Calhoun—the
exposure of the forgeries—the
indictment of the chief conspirators,
Calhoun, McLean and others—their
flight from Kansas never to return—and
the abandonment by Buchanan’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
administration, and his party in
Congress of the Lecompton Constitution,
which fell covered with execrations
and infamy. This closed the long
struggle to force slavery on Kansas,
and the new State was thereupon
admitted under a Free Constitution
made by her own people.”</p>

<p>To pass from this struggle for freedom
to the greater struggle in the
wider field of the war that followed,
was but a logical step to the young
advocate who had devoted so much of
his time to the cause that had won his
heart. He first appears in that struggle
as Colonel of the Eleventh Regiment
of Kansas Volunteer Infantry,
recruited and organized by him in the
summer of 1862. He led his command
in several severe engagements
in Arkansas—at Cane Hill, Van Buren
and Prairie Grove; and for gallant
conduct in the last named battle,
which was one of the fiercest of the
war, was promoted to be a Brigadier-General
on the 11th of March, 1863.
He was soon after assigned to the
command of the “District of the
Border,” comprising the State of Kansas
and the western portion of Missouri—a
command of extreme administrative
difficulty and great personal
danger, which he held from June,
1863, to February, 1864, and in which
he won the emphatic approval of
President Lincoln and General Schofield,
the Department Commander.
His “Order No. 11,” issued while he
held this command, directing the
inhabitants of large portions of three
border counties of southern Missouri
to remove to the military posts or out
of the border, was and still is severely
criticised. It was the result of a
peculiarly difficult situation, solvable
in no other way.</p>

<p>Those counties had become the
impregnable base of operations of
about a thousand guerrillas, under
Quantrell, the James brothers, and
Yeager, who were incessantly making
incursions into southern Kansas, to
rob and kill the defenceless people,
and who had just burned Lawrence,
and in cold blood murdered nearly
three hundred unarmed and unresisting
citizens. After two years of strenuous
effort by other Union commanders,
it had proved to be impossible to
protect Kansas people from these
dreadful incursions, and equally impossible
to run the guerillas to earth
in their fastness on the Missouri side
of the border. These counties had
been desolated early in the war by
Jennison, Hoyt and their lawless
bands of Kansas “Red Legs”—burned
to the subsoil, nineteen farms out of
twenty having been absolutely abandoned,
and the houses and fences
destroyed or left rotting. The condition
of this district can be imagined
from the fact that when this “Order
No. 11” was issued, Nevada, the
county seat of Vernon County, having
at least a hundred houses standing
and in good order, had not a single
inhabitant, and the Court House without
door or window-pane, had become
a shelter for hogs and cattle running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
wild, with its records of titles and
court proceedings scattered over the
floors, and covered with filth. There
were not at that time a hundred families
left in the entire district affected
by the order, outside of the military
posts. They were the friends and
kinsfolk of the guerillas, who were
constantly hanging about the garrisoned
towns, buying arms, ammunition
and provisions for the guerillas,
and carrying news to them of every
movement of our troops. It was
impossible to kill the guerillas or drive
them out of the border while these
country people stayed there as their
spies and purveyors. Therefore, after
full conference with General Schofield,
then commanding the Department of
the Missouri, and now the honored
head of the army, General Ewing
ordered the few remaining inhabitants
in these desolated districts to remove
to the nearest military post, or back to
the second tier of counties from the
State border, and the order was subsequently
ratified by President
Lincoln.</p>

<p>In a letter published since the war,
General Schofield said: “The responsibility
for that order rests with President
Lincoln, myself, and General
Ewing, in the proportion of our
respective rank and authority.”
About half of the people affected by
the order removed to the posts under
the protection of our troops, and the
remainder further back in Missouri.
They moved in summer—were subjected
to no physical force or hardship,
and were generally glad to get out of
reach of the wild storm which was
about to burst on them from Kansas,
in revenge for the Lawrence massacre,
and which the Government had not
troops enough there to quell. Within
two or three months after the issuance
of this order, Quantrell having lost
his spies and purveyors, and finding it
impossible therefore to continue the
vendetta, led all his guerillas south,
and the border war was thus forever
ended.</p>

<p>General Ewing’s most distinguished
service during the war was in fighting
the battle of Pilot Knob on the 27th
and 28th of September, 1864. The
Confederate General, Sterling Price,
having effected an unlooked for and
unresisted crossing of the Arkansas
above Little Rock, with his army of
over twenty thousand men, marched
on St. Louis, where General Rosecrans
was in command of the Department
of the Missouri, and General Ewing
of the District of Southeast Missouri.
All the Federal troops of the department
were scattered in small detachments,
with bases in earthworks or
stockades in or near the chief towns
of Missouri, which were the places of
refuge of the Union men and neutrals
from the savage warfare of the guerillas.
These scattered troops could not
be withdrawn from their posts without
enormous sacrifice of the people and
property they were protecting, and it
was, moreover, impossible to assemble
them at St. Louis in time and
numbers sufficient to defeat Price’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
large army, which was increasing
rapidly by accessions of guerillas
from all parts of Southern Missouri.
There was but one possible means of
preventing the capture of St. Louis
and the vast loss of prestige and resources
which would follow. That
was to delay Price a few days until re-enforcements
could arrive from Little
Rock, by occupying and holding fast
to Fort Davidson, a small hexagonal
work capable of being manned by
about one thousand men, situated
ninety miles south of St. Louis, at the
village of Pilot Knob, which was then
the southern terminus of the Iron
Mountain Railroad. In this little fort
were stored immense amounts of ordnance,
commissary and quartermasters’
supplies, which Price greatly
needed, and which lay directly between
him and the great city, by
capturing which he expected to bring
Missouri over to the Confederacy.
General Rosecrans, at the urgent
request of General Ewing, reluctantly
consented that he should lead this
forlorn hope. He reached Pilot Knob
in the nick of time—but four hours
ahead of Price’s advance—and with
but one thousand and eighty men he
held Fort Davidson against two of the
three divisions of Price’s army—those
of Marmaduke and Cabell—numbering
about fourteen thousand men—Shelpy’s
division of about seven thousand
men having been sent to Ewing’s rear
at Mineral Point, twenty miles north
of Pilot Knob, to cut the railroad and
insure the destruction or capture of
his entire command. After repulsing
two assaults with great loss to the
enemy, General Ewing, under cover
of the night, evacuated and then blew
up his untenable fort, and, favored by
broken ground, though pressed on
flank and rear, held his force in hand,
and by dogged fighting for two days
and nights, brought them to a fortified
camp at Rolla, a hundred miles west
of Pilot Knob. Price was thus delayed
for a week, and drawn so far
westward from his march on St. Louis,
that reinforcements reached St. Louis
and the great objective of his invasion
was lost. He turned west and south
and was soon driven from Missouri
without striking an effective blow.
General Rosecrans, in a special order
issued October 6, 1864, said of this
brilliant episode: “With pride and
pleasure the commanding General
notices the gallant conduct of Brigadier-General
Thomas Ewing, Jr., and
his command in the defence of Pilot
Knob, and in the subsequent retreat to
Rolla. With scarcely one thousand
effective men, they repulsed the attacks
of Price’s invading army, and
successfully retreated with their battery
a distance of one hundred miles,
in the face of a pursuing and assailing
cavalry force of five times their number.
General Ewing and his subordinates
have deserved well of their
country. Under such commanders,
the Federal troops should always
march to victory.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the war, General
Ewing once more made his home in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
his native State. He was soon prominent
in political affairs, giving his
voice and vote to such measures as in
his opinion were for the best interests
of his country. He was a member of
the Ohio constitutional convention of
1873-4, where his legal attainments
and admirable powers of debate gave
him a foremost place. As a member
of the Democratic majority in the
Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth Congresses,
he was one of the leaders of his party
in resisting and stopping the employment
of Federal troops and supervisors
at elections conducted under State
laws, and also in the successful movement
for the preservation of the Greenback
currency, the remonetization of
silver, and the issue of silver certificates,
but for which measures of finance
the currency would have been greatly
contracted, to the infinite and protracted
distress of the industrial and
debtor classes. In 1879, he was the
Democratic candidate for governor of
Ohio, and made an able canvass of
the State, but the Republican majority
was too large to be overcome.</p>

<p>In 1882, that magnetic attraction
that draws so many men to New York
city, made General Ewing a member
of the bar of the metropolis, where the
enlarged opportunities of his profession
have been met by a mental equipment
and training equal to their most exacting
requirements, and where his
success has been of a marked character.
To this legal ability is added a
ripe scholarship, unusual grace as a
speaker, and a personal magnetism
that charms all with whom he comes
in contact. His published speeches
in Congress and on the stump have
been numerous, and marked by their
information, ability, liberality of
thought and patriotism. Although his
purely literary efforts have been less
numerous, because of the active
professional life that has been thrust
upon him, the work he has done in that
direction shows how much he might
have accomplished, had his life been
given to letters; for example, an
address delivered at the Centennial
celebration of the settlement of the
Northwest territory at Marietta, Ohio,
July, 16, 1889, and his address before
the Kansas State Bar Association, on
January 7, 1890, favoring the abolition
of the requirement of unanimity, of
juries in civil cases, and urging the
codification of the “private law”—both
of which speeches have attracted
wide attention, and most favorable
comment.</p>

<p>While General Ewing has accomplished
so much, he is still in his prime,
and is one of the moral forces in his
profession in New York city, a strong,
well-balanced and successful man. As
has been said, he takes a deep interest
in the affairs of the Society he did so
much to create, and with him, an
“Ohio man,” whether known or
unknown, is always sure of a cordial
welcome; while he enjoys life in his
new home, his love for the State that
gave him birth, and which his honored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
father so long served, is as deep as
that of a son for a mother whose face
he does not see, but whose memory is
forever carried in his heart.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Col. William L. Strong—One of the First Vice-Presidents of the Ohio Society.</span></h3>

<p>In the sketches of the two distinguished
Ohioans which accompany
this, the law has been so well represented
that one might imagine that the
chief purpose of Ohio in the metropolis
was to interpret the law, and see that
equal justice was done between man
and man; but from that which follows,
it will be seen that the mission of the
Buckeye in New York, is as varied as
his numbers are many, and that in the
walks of business and financial operation,
he has won honor for his mother-state,
and the evidences of deserved
success for himself. And while
engaged in the cares of business, he
has not forgotten to fulfill all the
demands of good citizenship, nor to
preserve the memory of the State he
has left, by doing all that lies in his
power to perpetuate her memory
loyally and lovingly in the one of his
adoption.</p>

<p>Those who have attended the meetings
of the Ohio Society with any
degree of regularity, have not failed to
notice that the genial presiding officer,
Gen. Swayne, whose genius for his
position is universally recognized
is never so well satisfied as when he
can so twist or change the current of
business as to bring upon the floor a
gentleman who always talks entertainingly,
and whose appearance and
speech justify the efforts of the presiding officer
to “draw him out.” Col.
William L. Strong has been so many
years in New York, that people generally
suppose him to be of New York
origin; he has travelled the world so
much, that at times it is hard to tell
from what section he does hail; but
when he has been brought before the
Society upon one of the occasions
above referred to, it takes no skill and
no endeavor to tell that he was an Ohio
man in the beginning, and that many
of the tendrils of his affection still cling
to the State in which his youth was
spent, and to which he turns with a
loyal devotion, whenever the occasion
renews the scenes of memory, and the
other sons of Ohio about him are recalling
with varied emotions the things
of the vanished past.</p>

<p>Mr. Strong came to New York when
quite young in years, but equipped
with all the elements needed for business
success. He was born in Richland
County, Ohio, on the 22d of March,
1827, and spent his boyhood among
the Loudinville hills. At the age of
sixteen he went to Wooster, Ohio, and
spent two years with the firm of Lake
&amp; Jones, a large retail dry goods house,
and from thence to Mansfield, Ohio,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
where he continued in the dry goods
business until he came to this city,
arriving here on the 31st of December,
1853.</p>

<p>When the young Buckeye reached
the great city, he came with a purpose
of making the best use of all the possibilities
which might present themselves.
He commenced life here as a
salesman in the well-known dry goods
house of L. O. Wilson &amp; Co., at that
time one of the largest and most prominent
of the wholesale houses of the
United States. In the panic of 1857
the firm suspended, but Mr. Strong continued
in its service until 1858, when
he went into the dry goods commission
business, entering the firm of Farnham,
Dale &amp; Co., which was one of the
prominent firms of New York at that
time. In the subsequent changes of
affairs, it was succeeded by Farnham,
Sutton &amp; Co., and afterwards by Sutton,
Smith &amp; Co. This last named firm was
dissolved and retired from business in
December, 1869, and on January 1,
1870, the firm of W. L. Strong &amp; Co.
was organized, and succeeded to the
business.</p>

<p>The advance of Mr. Strong in his
chosen line, had been as rapid as his
wonderful success in these later years,
has been deserved. He had entered
upon the work with a determination to
succeed, and nothing in the line of hard
work or close application was allowed
to stand in the way. He had made
the interests of his employers his own;
he had studied all the needs and possibilities
of the situation, and had laid a
sure foundation for future success. He
had learned the country from one end
to the other, and his business acquaintances
were to be found in every quarter.
It hardly needs to be added that
when the new firm of which he was the
head, opened its doors for business, it
had already a clientage of the most
valuable sort, and that its prominent
place among the great dry goods
houses of America, was already assured.</p>

<p>Col. Strong has been a faithful servant
of the house from the beginning;
he has done his work as if the whole
load fell upon him, and he has never
asked anyone to carry any share that
properly belonged to himself. The
house has ever been recognized as one
of the solid institutions of New York.
It has made but one removal since its
organization, beginning business on
the corner of Church and Leonard
streets, and moving several years later
to the spacious double store which it
still occupies, in the center of the dry
goods district at Nos. 75 and 77 Worth
street.</p>

<p>Some of the qualities that have made
his firm what it is to-day, are suggested
in the above. Mr. Strong is a man of
decided views, and great force of
character, and at the same time one of
the most approachable and genial men
in the business. His good nature and
open-handed liberality are widely felt
and known, and no man has a wider
circle of personal and business friends.
His abilities as a business man and
financier are of the highest order, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
although strongly marked by conservatism
and caution, are nevertheless,
sufficiently progressive for even this
day of commercial activity.</p>

<p>But while Col. Strong has given the
greater share of his time and care to the
interests of the firm of which he is the
head, he has found time to make his
energy and capital effective in various
other directions. He was for years a
director of the Central National Bank,
and for three years past has been
its president; is president of the
Homer Lee Bank Note Company;
was president of the Brush Electric
Light Company of New York for
several years; is president of the
Griswold Worsted Company, a large
corporation engaged in the manufacture
of silk and worsted materials. He
is also a director in the Erie Railroad
Company; a director in the New York
Life Insurance Company, Mercantile
Trust Company, and Hanover Fire
Insurance Company. He is also vice-president
of the New York Security
and Trust Company; is a director in
the newly formed Plaza Bank, and has
been closely connected with other important
commercial and financial enterprises
not necessary to mention in
detail here.</p>

<p>In the lines of political duty, social
demands, and especially in connection
with such enterprises as have had some
object of public benefit in view, Col.
Strong has ever been an active factor.
He is of the Republican faith, and has
long been recognized as one of the
Republican leaders of New York. He
has been importuned many times to
be a candidate for public office, but
has been too closely interested in his
business to take a hand in the practical
manipulation of politics upon his
own account, content to do a citizen’s
duty, and to remain in private life. But
he has done that duty whenever occasion
offered. He is a member of the
Union League, and president of the
Business Men’s Republican Association,
and has done much to make that
one of the most efficient and useful
political associations of the country.
He has ever taken a deep interest in
the Ohio Society, and is at present its
first vice-president, and has held that
office from the date of its organization.</p>

<p>No words can too strongly describe
the high repute in which is held the
business house of which Col. Strong is
the head. It is among the most prominent,
popular and successful in the
trade. It represents some of the largest
mills in this country engaged in
the manufacture of dress goods, flannels,
blankets and other woolens and
worsteds, also important accounts in
cotton goods. It has branch houses in
Boston and Philadelphia for the supply
of the trade in those markets. The
firm was organized January 1, 1870,
as above stated, and has continued in
uninterrupted and successful operation
ever since. Through all the panics
and business disturbances that have
visited this country at various periods
since 1870, the house passed in safety
with increased business prestige and
financial strength. The able business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
management of this large commission
house is proverbial in mercantile circles.</p>

<p>All that has been said in the above,
in commendation of the house of which
Col. Strong is the visible head, may be
truthfully repeated of himself in his
personal relations. His connection
with many enterprises of importance in
the business community and his prominent
position in the same, are evidences
of the business ability which
he possesses and which his associates
have so practically recognized. Modest
and unassuming, his clear and
analytical mind grasps the problems
of business with such skill that fortune
has smiled upon every enterprise with
which he is or has been associated.
His connection with so many financial
institutions as director or president,
further attests the confidence of the
public in his integrity and marked
ability.</p>

<p>While his business qualifications are
of very high order, there are other
traits in the character of Col. Strong
that are no less marked. He is a man
of the people, and his sympathies are
wholly with the people. No worthy
object to relieve or to make the struggling
masses happy, ever fails to receive
from him the substantial sympathy
which his broad mind and
liberal heart so freely give. He is an
American, in every sense of the term.
Plain and simple in his habits, he
frowns upon everything that seeks to
make one man higher than another,
except as merit or exceptional service,
have elevated him. He is, as one has
well said, “One of the few men equal
to the occasion, wherever placed, and
deservedly possesses the entire confidence
of the people.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hon. George Hoadly, Ex-Governor of Ohio.</span></h3>

<p>George Hoadly, who has won at the
bar of New York, a position of eminence
equal to that he for years maintained
in Ohio, is, in all the essentials
of affection and personal loyalty, yet
an “Ohio man,” for he remembers the
home of his youth, the scene of his
early labors and professional advancement,
and the State that chose him to
the highest position within her gift.
Like General Ewing and Col. Strong,
he is already a well-known figure in
the metropolis, and is one of the men
by whose labors the Ohio Society has
been made what it is.</p>

<p>If a man is aided by the “sort of
grandfathers” he has inherited, Judge
Hoadly had as fair a start as is given
anyone. The older lawyers of Ohio
speak with tender remembrance of
“Squire Hoadly,” who for years was
one of the imposing figures of the bar
of Cleveland, and whose purity of
character was matched only by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
legal knowledge, and the justice with
which, in his magisterial character, he
arbitrated the affairs of his fellowmen.
He made Cleveland his home in 1830;
served one term as Mayor, and for
fifteen years as justice of the peace,
then an office of greater honor and responsibility
than in these days of multiplied
minor and municipal courts.</p>

<p>The son, George Hoadly, was born
in New Haven, Connecticut, on July
31, 1826, of a mother (Mary Anne
Woolsey), who counted Jonathan Edwards
among her direct ancestors,
President Dwight her uncle, President
Woolsey her younger brother, Theodore
Winthrop, Sarah Woolsey, (“Susan
Coolidge,”) her nephew and niece.
Carried to Ohio when but four years of
age, his primary education was received
in the private school, conducted
by the late Franklin T. Backus,
afterwards the leader of the Cleveland
bar, and Judge William Strong of Oregon.
When fourteen years of age he
entered Western Reserve College, at
Hudson, Ohio, from which he was
graduated in 1844. It had already
been impressed upon him by natural
bent of mind and inclination, and by
the advice of those who had studied
his character and watched his growth,
that the law was his proper profession,
and he accordingly spent a year in
study at the famous law school at
Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he
was under the instruction of Judge
Story and Prof. Greenleaf. One more
year of close study was passed in the
office of Judge Charles C. Convers, at
Zanesville, Ohio, and then young
Hoadly went to Cincinnati, and in the
fall of 1846 entered the law office of
Chase &amp; Ball, where he completed his
studies, and was admitted to the bar
in August of the following year. An
incident of more than passing moment
in his personal and professional life
grew out of this connection. “Young
Hoadly,” says one of the governor’s
biographers, “at once attracted the attention
and secured the warm and
lasting friendship of his preceptor, Salmon
P. Chase, afterwards Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United
States, who was well aware of the importance
of attaching to himself young
men of ability, and, after a period of
service as a clerk, Mr. Hoadly was admitted,
in 1849, as a junior partner into
the firm, which took the name of
Chase, Ball &amp; Hoadly. Mr. Chase was
soon thereafter elected United States
Senator, and withdrew from professional
activity in Cincinnati, and this
led to Hoadly’s appearing in important
cases very early in his career.”</p>

<p>Strong and able in his profession,
and popular with the people, the
young lawyer’s way to official distinction
was soon opened. In 1851,
the State Legislature elected him Judge
of the Superior Court of Cincinnati,
for the residue of the term to which
that court had been limited by the
constitutional convention. He ably
served in this position until 1853, when
the court ceased its functions, and he
then formed a co-partnership with
Edward Mills. He was city solicitor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of Cincinnati in 1855, and 1856, and
became a member of the present
Superior Court in 1859. Twice was he
offered a seat upon the Supreme Bench
of Ohio, but each time he declined. In
1856, the proffer came from Governor
Chase, and in 1862 from Governor Tod.
In 1864 he was re-elected to the bench,
but resigned in 1866, at which time the
firm of Hoadly, Jackson &amp; Johnson was
formed. The late Judge Alphonse Taft
was his successor upon the bench.
The new combination was soon
ranked among the great law firms of
the country, and Judge Hoadly was
classed as one of the ablest and soundest
of American jurists. Of this period
of his life, an historian of Ohio has
said: “They (the above mentioned
law firm), have successfully tried some
of the great railroad cases of the day,
and are as noted in these cases in Ohio
as was Samuel J. Tilden in New York
ten years ago in litigation of the same
kind. Judge Hoadly has also appeared
as counsel in the most important
litigations of other kinds tried in
Ohio of late years, having among others
conducted victoriously the cases involving
the use of the Bible in the
common schools of Cincinnati, the
constitutionality of the Pond and Scott
laws, and in the United States Supreme
Court overthrown the Federal trade-mark
system, and compelled the State
of Tennessee to redeem the issues of
the Bank of Tennessee.”</p>

<p>A position where his peculiar legal
powers were called into play, and his
knowledge of constitutional law and
readiness in debate made him a leader,
was his membership in the Ohio constitutional
convention of 1873-4, to
which he was elected without opposition
from Hamilton County. Yet
while engaged in the manifold duties
of his profession, he found time to engage
in other fields of usefulness, serving
as professor in the Cincinnati Law
School, a chair of which he held for
over twenty years; a trustee of the
University of Cincinnati, and of the
Cincinnati Museum; member of the
Committee of the School of Design;
and was in other ways the patron of
the arts and sciences, and a promoter
of their development in his home city.
Among other self-imposed tasks, he
made himself acquainted with the
Spanish and German languages, and
became as he calls himself “a poor
stenographer.”</p>

<p>While Judge Hoadly had thus far
allowed his name to be used only in
connection with official positions directly
in the line of his profession, and
while he had little taste and less time
for the practical part of politics, he
still held pronounced views upon public
questions, and carefully watched
the drift of events. He was from the
first a Democrat—as his father had
been before him—a believer in democratic
principles as enunciated by the
founders of the party who were among
the greatest of the founders of our
government. And being a Democrat
to the logical conclusions of democracy,
he took issue with his party upon
the question of human slavery. During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the war, he acted politically with
the Union elements; when peace was
restored and the slave freed, he took
part in the Liberal Republican movement
of 1872, and was a member of
the Cincinnati convention, and of its
Committee on Resolutions, but disapproved
of the nomination of Mr. Greeley
with whom he had no political
principles in common except hatred of
slavery and belief in hard money. He
withdrew from the convention immediately
after the nomination was made,
and entered into correspondence with
leading Democrats, endeavoring to
bring about the nomination of a Democratic
candidate whom he stood ready
to support. Failing in this, he reluctantly
voted for Grant’s second election.</p>

<p>In 1876, Judge Hoadly earnestly
entered into the movement known to
contemporary history as “Tilden and
Reform,” believing that the interests of
the country would be best subserved
by the election of Tilden and Hendricks.
In the memorable legal contest
that ensued, before the electoral
commission, the Democratic Committee
invited Judge Hoadly to argue the
Oregon and Florida cases before that
body, which he did in such manner
as to make national a reputation for
legal ability that had heretofore been
largely confined to his own portion of
the West. This probably caused his
call to the (temporary) presidency of
the Democratic National Convention of
1880.</p>

<p>One of the immediate but unpremeditated
fruits of this political activity
came in 1883, when Judge Hoadly
was named by the Democrats of Ohio
as their candidate for governor. He
entered upon the canvas with activity,
and his speeches at Hamilton and
Piqua, were reported and eagerly
circulated by the Democratic State
Committee as campaign documents.
After making some ten speeches, he was
unfortunately stricken with malarial
fever, which prevented his continuing
upon the stump until the last week of
the campaign. Although not yet entirely
recovered, he was able to appear in
Cleveland, Sandusky, Toledo and
Dayton, addressing immense audiences
with marked effect. A campaign
that had of necessity lagged because
of the absence of its chief, took on a
new vigor, the Democratic heart was
fired anew, and George Hoadly became
Governor of the State by the
emphatic majority of 12,529 over
Judge Foraker, the Republican nominee.
Not only this, but the close
counties went Democratic, a legislature
was secured, and Henry B.
Payne, the life-long friend of Governor
Hoadly’s father, was sent to represent
Ohio in the United States
Senate.</p>

<p>It is a matter of settled historical
opinion, that the Buckeye State, with
all its famous governors, was never
possessed of a better chief magistrate
than the one whose administration
opened under such favoring influences.
A knowledge of the needs of the state,
gained from long acquaintance, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
wisdom that could be made effective
in practical affairs, calm judgment,
and an eye that could look higher
than the levels of mere partisanship,
were among the things that aided him;
and “the greatest good to the greatest
number” was the principle that inspired
all his acts.</p>

<p>A renomination was, of course, a
foregone conclusion. In 1885, the
Democratic State Convention proclaimed
by acclamation that George
Hoadly should again become its candidate
for governor. He accepted,
although knowing that Ohio was then
practically a Republican State, and
that one man could hardly expect to
accomplish the miracle of permanent
Democracy. Judge Foraker was once
more the Republican choice, and in
the fall election was chosen by a vote
of 359,281 to 341,830 for Hoadly;
the Rev. A. B. Leonard, the Prohibition
candidate receiving 28,081, and
John W. Northrup, the Greenback candidate
2,001 votes. Although the
defeat was decisive, it was sweetened
to Governor Hoadly by the fact that in
1885, as in 1883, he ran ahead of his ticket,
being defeated by the smallest, and,
in 1883 elected by the largest plurality
given against or for any of the gentlemen
upon the same ticket.</p>

<p>When Governor Hoadly saw his
successor duly inaugurated, he cheerfully
returned to the active labors of
his profession, in Cincinnati, where
he remained until March, 1887, when
the call to the chief city of the Union
came in such shape that it could not
be ignored. His practice had extended
into such fields that the removal
was almost a necessity, and his
health demanded a change of climate.
He located in New York, and became
a partner in the firm of Hoadly, Lauterbach
&amp; Johnson—a firm that stands
in the front rank, and that has an immense
clientage, not only in New
York, but all through the country.
His chief thought and ambition since
then has been in his profession. In
the spring of 1890, Governor David B.
Hill appointed him a member of the
commission to revise the judiciary
article of the constitution of New
York, but because of professional engagements
which detained him in the
trial of a case in Detroit, Michigan,
during the entire spring and summer
months of that year, he was compelled
to decline the appointment.</p>

<p>In recent years, Judge Hoadly has
been honored by the degree of Doctor
of Laws, conferred by Yale College
in 1885, by Dartmouth College in
1889, while his own college, once
Hudson but now Adelbert, gave him
the same title some years ago. He is
a Free Mason, a Knight Templar, and
has taken the 33rd degree of the
Ancient and Accepted Scottish rite,
and has always performed anything
in his power to advance the interests
of the order.</p>

<p>Of Judge Hoadly’s professional life
in New York, much might be said,
were this the place to say it. Outside
of that, little can be said, for he has
had time for little else. As “an Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
man” he is always at home to any
Buckeye neighbor, or impression, or
memory that connect him with the days
and scenes of his youth and early manhood.
He may be seen occasionally
in the gatherings of the Ohio Society,
and when there, he is not allowed to
remain in his seat unheard. Few
men are as approachable in any walk
of life; few men more companionable
when he can command leisure for
companionship. His friendships are
strong, his decisions intuitive, his
principles those of his honored ancestors,
and Jonathan Edwards’ severe
theology has had little reflection
in his generous religious views. A
single phrase might sum up his whole
life and character: A typical American
jurist and gentlemen.</p>

</div>

<p>North Americans will probably always
take a special interest in the
adventures of the army of the Spanish
commander De Soto, apart from the
general charm of the subject, for it is to
the chronicles of the same that they
are indebted for the very earliest accounts
of the Indian nations, who, in
the sixteenth century inhabited the
territory now comprising the southeastern
quarter of the United States.</p>

<p>The route pursued by the expedition
during the years 1539 to 1543 has long
been the subject of much discussion,
but no satisfactory conclusions have
been arrived at concerning the matter
as a whole. Indeed there can scarcely
be said to be a single point on the
entire line of march which has been
established beyond cavil. It is not
now my intention to add to the mass
of general comment, but merely to
treat of a certain point of the route
which personal enquiry and exploration
in the field have enabled me to
make up my mind about in all surety.</p>

<p>This point is the location of the
particular village of the Chickasaws
in northeastern Mississippi, where De
Soto went into camp on December 17,
1540, and of the smaller village to the
northward whither he retreated about
the first week in the ensuing March,
after the fierce night attack of the
natives which almost ruined the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to give my own
conclusions as to the true position of
these villages, it is but proper to furnish
an abstract of the descriptions
given by the old writers, together with
the opinions of the modern historians
of Mississippi and of other people
now inhabiting the northeastern counties
of the State. The various authorities
(excepting the popular views) will
be quoted in the order in which they
have appeared in printed form before
the world.</p>

<p>The anonymous “Gentleman of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Elvas” one of the Portuguese volunteers,
an eye-witness, comes first.
His work, the “True Relation” etc.,
appeared in 1557. He says that Chicaza
was a small town of twenty
houses, and that the land was thickly
inhabited, and that it was fertile, the
greater part being under cultivation.
Also that the Spaniards removed from
that town where they wintered to the
one where the cacique was accustomed
to live, half a league off, because it
was in the open country, on a prairie
favorable for them.</p>

<p>The second authority is Garcilaso
de la Vega, “the Inca,” who, however,
was only a compiler, writing in 1591,
from information given by three separate
members of the little army. His
book, “La Florida del Ynca” etc.,
first appeared in 1605. It furnishes a
more elaborate account of the Chicaza
transactions than the proceeding one,
and to the following effect. The place
had two hundred fires and was situated
on a hill extending north and
south, which was watered by many
little brooks covered with nut, oak,
and other similar trees. In order to
lodge more commodiously they built
themselves houses with wood and
straw that they procured from the
neighboring villages. Three days
after the fight referred to, the General
ordered the force to advance a league,
search for wood and straw, and build
a town to be named Chicacilla.</p>

<p>Factor Biedma’s account of the expedition,
first published (in French) in
1841, is a very brief one. In the Chicaza
affair, Buckingham Smith (1866)
renders his words as stating that the
army moved to “a cottage about a
mile off.”</p>

<p>Nor does the abridged journal of Rodrigo
Ranjel, De Soto’s private secretary,
which was not printed till 1851,
afford any information as to the first
town. But he relates how the Spaniards,
after their defeat, at once went to
a savana or prairie a league off, where
they erected huts and barracks, and
established camp on a declivity and
hill.</p>

<p>As may be easily supposed the next
Europeans to visit that region, the
English and French traders and soldiers
of the eighteenth century, had
more urgent matters to attend to than
the verification of historical statements,
for no mention of De Soto or the
expedition is made in their scanty
writings or reports on this region, and
apparently the Chickasaws had forgotten
all about his invasion. The American
settlers of nearly a century later
were still less likely to know about the
matter, for the De Soto expedition can
scarcely be said to have become
known to people in general in the
United States till after the publication
of Theodore Irving’s interesting book
in 1835.</p>

<p>Searching next in all accessible
modern histories and books, the first
attempt at definite localizing that I
can find is in the appendix to the
Smithsonian Report for 1867. The
Rev. Samuel Agnew, writing from
Guntown, Mississippi, under date of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
January 11, 1868, states that twelve
years before, there had been pointed
out to him on a long ridge between
John’s Creek and Friendship Church,
in Pontotoc County, the remains of
ancient ditches or embankments.
These he surmised might probably be
the remains of De Soto’s winter camp,
but he hoped that some intelligent antiquarian
would look further into the
matter.</p>

<p>The most comprehensive attempt
however, to identify these camps, was
made by Hon. J. F. H. Claiborne, in his
“Mississippi as a Province” etc., published
in 1880. In this book he wrote
that:—</p>

<p>“There (the old Indian trail) struck
Pontotoc ridge, four miles east of the
ancient Chickasaw Council House.
Near this point stood the first Chickasaw
town, and in this vicinity the
Spaniards went into winter quarters.</p>

<p>“At that period a portion of the
Chickasaws still resided in the mountain
region of east Tennessee, but a
large body of them had taken possession
of the territory where De Soto
found them, and their principal settlement
or town, or series of villages,
was on the ridge from the ancient
Council House (near Redland) north
fifteen miles (near Pontotoc) and northeast,
on the ‘mean prairie’ eight or
ten miles, within a few miles of Tallahatchie
River....</p>

<p>“Four miles east of the ancient
Council House, on the Pontotoc ridge,
near the source of the Suckartonchee
Creek, are the vestiges of a fortified
camp, evidently once strongly entrenched,
after the European style of
that day, with bastions and towers.
Leaden balls and fragments of metal
have been often found in these ruins.
The enclosure was square, and the
whole area, as evidenced by the remains,
would have afforded shelter to
the Spaniards and their live stock....
The chief of the Chickasaws resided
about two miles southeast of the present
town of Pontotoc, on the head-waters
of Coonawa, now called Pontotoc
Creek.... The exact position
of this entrenched camp is still
indicated by the vestiges that remain.
Some persons contend that De Soto
left this stronghold, advanced to Chickasilla,
one mile northwest from where
Pontotoc now stands, and commenced
the attack on the Chickasaw towns.
This would be to reverse the detailed
accounts of the writers that accompanied
him.... After the destruction
of their camp, the Spaniards
moved three miles to the village of
Chickasilla, where they were annoyed
by desultory attacks.”</p>

<p>In forming his opinions on the
matter, Claiborne acknowledged his
indebtedness to W. J. N. Walton of
Aberdeen, Mississippi, a gentleman
who “in early life was secretary of
Levi Colbert, head chief of the Chickasaws,
familiar with their language
and with all their traditions,” and to
W. B. Wilkes of the same place, a man
whose tastes inclined him to archaeological
pursuits. It is with diffidence
therefore, that I venture to disagree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
with these conclusions, in my own
statement.</p>

<p>As to the ideas of the farmers and
others living in the old Chickasaw
County, there is no uniformity of
opinion as to the site of Soto’s camps.
There are many local candidates for
that honor, and so far as I could find
out, there is no good reason to adopt
one more than another. The place
pointed out to Mr. Agnew is probably
the site of Mound Builder’s work,
of which class of remains there is no
lack in northern Mississippi.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
same may be said of the position assigned
to Chicaza by Claiborne, though
the locality he means is rather to the
southeast of Redland and in Chickasaw
County.</p>

<p>The Chicaza of Soto’s time was on a
high ridge or hill located about one
mile northwest of Redland, on the
S½ of the S¼ of Section 21, and the
N½ of the N W½ of Section 28, town
11, range 3E. in Pontotoc county. The
hill extends north and south, and on
both sides there are many little spring
branches flowing out of the base of the
hill and uniting with the larger streams
at a distance of from one to four or
five rods. The main part of the town
was located on Section 28. A part of
it is under cultivation and has farm
buildings upon it, while the remainder
of the site is covered by young timber
and brush.</p>

<p>Many years ago there was an Indian
mission school that is said to have
been located where the farm building
now stands. In the new ground broken
up within recent years, there were
beds of charcoal and ashes found at
different points, and even in the old
portion of the cultivated land charcoal
is occasionally brought to the surface
by the plough. These are undoubtedly
remains of old Chicaza, and the beds
of charcoal and ashes mark the sites
of the houses burned by the Indians.
As regards the location, there is no
other place in either Lee or Pontotoc
counties—where the oldest Chickasaw
settlements were undoubtedly situated—that
corresponds to the topographical
description given by the Inca.</p>

<p>Chicacilla was probably located on
the S E¼ of Section 5, town 11, range
3 E., about 3½ miles north and a very
little west of Chicaza. At this point
there is debris, etc., indicating that
there was once an old Chickasaw village
there. The narratives of the expedition,
however, do not give sufficient
data regarding this site, so that
it is impossible to fully identify the
place by them, there being nothing beyond
the statement already quoted
that it was located on a sloping hill, a
league distant from Chicaza. This being
the only ancient Chickasaw village
site properly lying on sloping ground,
and at about the right distance from
the burned town; it is more than probable
that the position given above is
the correct one. It is presumable that
after the place was abandoned by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Spaniards, the Indians took possession
of it, and occupied the houses in lieu
of those destroyed by both parties.
Besides this, it supplied them with a
well fortified (palisaded) town in which
to re-establish themselves.</p>

<p>At these two towns of Chicaza and
Chicacilla, there are no vestiges of
fortifications or entrenchments of any
description, in fact there are none to
be found in any of the Chickasaw old
towns (or “fields”) that can be identified.
It is probable that the fortified
towns described in the De Soto and the
early French expeditions were merely
wooden walls or palisades, for otherwise
there would be traces of them
still remaining, so that at least some
of them could be recognized as such.</p>

<p>The above conclusions were incidentally
arrived at in the course of
some archaeological explorations made
in January and February 1891, in the
former country of the Chickasaws, and
may be considered as a contribution
to some future revision of the generally
accepted route of De Soto and his little
army east of the Mississippi.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hon. Isaac N. Arnold.</span></h3>

<p>Isaac Newton Arnold was born at
Hartwick, near Cooperstown, Otsego
Co., New York, Nov. 30, 1813. His
father George Washington Arnold was
a physician of honorable standing,
and the family in America dates back
to the earliest settlement of New England,
some of its members being
associates of Roger Williams and
other sterling men, who established in
Rhode Island the first real Republic
that ever gladdened the hearts of men
with its assertion and protection of liberty
and independent, sovereign manhood.
The natural surroundings of
his youth—the romantic scenery of
Otsego County, with its beautiful lakes
and extensive forests, so delightfully
picturesque—were well calculated
to develop a strong and noble
manhood. Amidst this beauty of
nature and comparative solitude, the
man who was to make such a success
of life drank in inspiration and
learned to love the pure and the beautiful.
Early thrown upon his own
resources, self-made and self-reliant,
he reached a position of greatness,
through a career of usefulness,
honor and integrity. His early
education was obtained in the country
schools and the village academy.
From seventeen to twenty years of
age he employed his time in teaching
half the year and in attending school
the other half, his revenue from
teaching enabling him to support
himself in his pursuit of an education.
Ultimately he began to
prepare himself for the profession in
which he afterwards achieved such a
notable success. Reading law in the
offices of Richard Cooper and Judge
Morehouse of Cooperstown, Mr. Arnold
was admitted to the bar in 1835, and
after practicing for a brief time as a
partner of Judge Morehouse, he came
to Chicago in 1836, and at once began
that illustrious professional career
which placed him among the foremost
jurists not only of Illinois, but of the
nation. It is scarcely possible to
have a more graphic and faithful picture
of a life than was drawn by Hon.
E. B. Washburne in his eloquent eulogy
of Mr. Arnold before the Chicago
Historical Society. He said: “During
all the active years of a long and
well-spent life, Mr. Arnold has been a
citizen of Chicago, contributing by his
indefatigable industry, his unimpeachable
integrity, his patriotism, his public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
spirit, his rare abilities, his great
acquirements, his spotless moral character,
his high social qualifications and
instincts as a thorough gentleman to
give lustre to the city of his residence
and to the generation to which he
belonged; a successful lawyer that
stood in the front ranks of his profession;
a cautious, far-seeing and wise
legislator, distinguishing himself in
the halls of legislation, national as
well as state; a successful public
speaker and a writer of great power
and wide-spread popularity, he has
left to the generations that succeed
him the legacy of a noble example
and a noble name.”</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold was enrolled at the bar
of the Supreme Court in Illinois Dec.
9, 1841, and in that same year he became
counsel in a case which established
his ability as a lawyer and
brought him prominently before the
profession. It was a time of great
business depression, and a recreant
legislature had passed an act of repudiation
of public debts and providing
that unless the property of a judgment
debtor should bring two-thirds
of its appraised value, it should not be
sold under execution. Mr. Arnold was
a determined opponent, of such legislation,
and being employed by a New
York judgment creditor to enforce his
claim against a debtor, he attacked the
constitutionality of the act, carried the
case to the Supreme Court of the United
States, where the case came on in
January, 1843. Mr. Arnold presented
an irrefutable written argument and
Chief Justice Taney in one of the ablest
and most elaborate opinions ever delivered
in the court, sustained the position
of the counsel for the appellant.
Mr. Arnold was a powerful advocate
whether before court or jury. He was
exceedingly pains-taking in the preparation
of his cases—which is half the
battle with the lawyer—and before
a jury he had no superior. As one
of his associates at the bar has put it:
“He was a learned lawyer, a jurist in
the same sense of the term, and for
more than thirty years stood at the
head of the Chicago bar.”</p>

<p>In 1842 he was elected to the Lower
House of the Illinois General Assembly.
There were in that body at this
time many men of distinction and
marked ability, but none that were
superior to the subject of this sketch.
In 1844 Mr. Arnold was again elected
to the House. At the close of this
session of the legislature in 1846, Mr.
Arnold retired from public life, and did
not re-enter it until 1856. In politics
he had been a Democrat, and in 1844
was a presidential elector on the Polk
ticket. But becoming indignant at the
repeal of the Missouri Compromise, he
became what was known as an anti-Nebraska
Democrat and in 1856, at
the urgent solicitation of the anti-Nebraska
Democrats and Republicans
of Cook County, he again consented
to become a candidate for the House
of Representatives in the State Legislature.
This was at the time that Bissel
was elected Governor and his right
to take the seat was challenged by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Democrats on the ground that he once
accepted a challenge to fight a duel.
Mr. Arnold championed the Governor’s
cause, and his speech in his defense
not only really settled the question,
but gave him a high reputation over
the whole State, marking him as one
of the ablest public men of the time.</p>

<p>In the historical election at which
Abraham Lincoln was first elected
President of the United States, Mr.
Arnold was elected a representative
in the Thirty-seventh Congress from
the Chicago district. That Congress
met in extra session, July 4, 1861, and
has passed into history as one of the
most notable and momentous events
in the life of the Republic. The Administration
at the time was confronted
by an open rebellion against the
National authority, and it was for this
session of Congress to determine just
what should be done in the premises.
Mr. Arnold had long known Mr. Lincoln,
and between the two men there
was a warm feeling of regard, and
perhaps no man took his seat in this
memorable session upon whom the
President placed greater reliance than
he did upon Mr. Arnold. The respect
that was generally entertained for his
abilities was evidenced by the fact
that he was selected to pronounce the
eulogy on the occasion of the death of
Stephen A. Douglass. The regular
session of the Thirty-seventh Congress
met on the second day of December,
1861, at a time when the country was
fully plunged into the midst of civil
war. Mr. Arnold took his seat in the
House, and at once entered actively
into all the important proceedings of
the body. His labors as a representative
were very great and of the highest
usefulness. Among his official acts
that will live forever as a memento to
his manhood and his statesmanship
was his vote to abolish slavery in the
District of Columbia and his introduction
of a bill, which against a determined
opposition he persistently
pushed to enactment, to prohibit slavery
in every place subject to the
National jurisdiction. One who knew
him well, expressed the opinion however,
that the ablest and most notable
speech which he made in Congress,
was the one delivered May 2, 1862, in
the support of the bill to confiscate
rebel property. This speech, because
of its value as an exponent of constitutional
law, challenged the attention
of the lawyer members. He was
ceaseless in administering blows
against the institution of slavery. He
acted in this regard steadily upon his
own declaration: “Whenever we can
give slavery a constitutional blow, let
us do it.” On February 15, 1863, he
introduced a resolution, which was
passed, declaring that the constitution
should be so amended as to abolish
slavery in the United States; and this
was the first step ever taken in Congress
in favor of the abolition and
prevention of slavery in the country.</p>

<p>In his speech advocating this resolution,
he uttered the following vigorous
language and eloquent sentiment:
“In view of the long catalogue of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
wrongs that slavery has inflicted upon
the country, I demand to-day in the
Congress of the United States the death
of slavery. We can have no permanent
peace while slavery lives. It
now reels and staggers in the last
death struggle. Let us strike the monster
this last decisive blow. Pass this
joint resolution and the Thirty-eighth
Congress will live in history as that
which consummated the great work of
freeing a continent from the curse of
human bondage. The great spectacle
of this vote which knocks off the fetters
of a whole race will make this
scene immortal.” Further on he said:
“I mean to fight this cause of the war—this
cause of the expenditure of all
the blood and treasure from which my
country is now suffering; this institution
which has filled our whole land
with sorrow, desolation and anguish—I
mean to fight it until neither on the
statute-book nor in the constitution
shall there be left a single sentence or
word which can be construed to sustain
the stupendous wrong. Let us now
in the name of Liberty, Justice and of
God consummate this grand resolution.
Let us now make our country the home
of the free.”</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold’s congressional career
ended with the Thirty-eighth Congress
March 3, 1865. He had served his
country so well, had given the Administration
such loyal, able and efficient
support and won such a splendid fame
that it was generally regretted that he
would not consent to be returned.
After President Lincoln’s assassination,
he accepted the appointment from President
Johnson of Auditor of the Treasury
for the Port Office department, as
a residence in Washington afforded
him a more ready access to documents
that were necessary to enable him to
complete his work entitled the “History
of Abraham Lincoln and the
Overthrow of Slavery in the United
States,” the preparation of which he
had commenced before the assassination.
He finally resigned the position
however, and returned to Chicago in
1867. He then completed his work
referred to, which is one of surprising
interest and of exceptional historic
value. In 1872, he resumed his bar
practice in Chicago and continued
actively in his profession for two or
three years, when failing health compelled
him to abandon it. From that
time until his death, he lived a retired
life in his pleasant home among his
books and papers, where surrounded
by his family and congenial friends
he dispensed an elegant and gracious
hospitality. He now had leisure to
devote himself to favorite literary pursuits.
He devoted himself to historic
themes as he had a love for historical
research, and a power of analysis
which enabled him to do valuable
work in historical and biographical
writing. In 1880, he brought out a
work entitled “Life of Benedict Arnold—His
Patriotism and His Treason.” It
is generally acknowledged to be a
work of ability and fairness. Certainly
it showed the independence and courage
of the author for it required something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of courage to meet the popular
prejudice with which the name of Benedict
Arnold is regarded. But the author
said that he wished to “make
known the patriotic service of Benedict
Arnold; the sufferings, heroism and the
wrongs which drove him to a desperate
action and induced one of the most
heroic men of an heroic age to perpetrate
an unpardonable crime.” The
book is really one of great historic
value. Mr. Arnold was never quite
satisfied with his work on Mr. Lincoln
and the overthrow of slavery. About
two years before his death, therefore,
he began to write the “Life of Abraham
Lincoln,” and it is upon this work,
says one of his ardent admirers, that
his reputation as a biographer and
historian must rest.</p>

<p>He was the author of a great number
of sketches. “To whatever he
undertook,” says one, “Mr. Arnold
brought the qualities of a ripe intelligence,
great vigor and a sound judgment.”
At an age when most men rest,
he was pursuing to its legitimate honors
and rewards the career of a man of
letters and of a historian. With an intellectual
and finely chiseled face, of an
erect and well-formed person, of quiet
and gentlemanly manners and courteous
carriage and bearing, Mr. Arnold
was a man who always attracted attention.
He was a communicant of
the Protestant Episcopal Church, and
for many years a vestryman of St.
James’ Church in Chicago. The successes
of life and the usual hardening
influences of public life had no effect
upon his manly Christian character.
The better side of his nature was at all
times in the ascendancy. His
earnest, paramount desire was to be
useful in the world, and he freely understood
that to gratify that desire man
must be alive to the claims of his fellow
man upon him. On his seventieth
birthday he wrote: “Three score and
ten; Death must be at no great distance.
I wish to live only so long as
I may be to some extent useful, and
not when I shall be a burden. May
my remaining days be useful and innocent.”
He was possessed of many
noble traits of character, not likely to
be known outside of his immediate
circle of friends. He was a great lover
of children, and devotedly tender in
his own home.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold was twice married. His
first marriage was with Catherine E.
Dorrance of Pittsfield, Mass., who died
October 1839. His second marriage was
with Harriet Augusta Dorrance, a sister
of his former wife, August 4, 1841.
Nine children were born of this marriage.
Mr. Arnold died at his residence
in Chicago, April 24, 1884, mourned by
the great city in which he lived and a
multitude of others who appreciate the
worth of true manhood. No citizen of
Chicago ever had more numerous or
more eloquent eulogies pronounced
upon his death; the memory of no
citizen was ever honored by such a
gathering of distinguished people as assembled
to pay the last sad tribute to
Mr. Arnold’s memory.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_ANCIENT_METHODS_OF_PUNISHMENT_IN_MASSACHUSETTS">SOME ANCIENT METHODS OF PUNISHMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Scarcely anything indicates so accurately
the predominant traits and
condition of a people at any given period,
as do the laws by which they are
governed and the mode in which those
laws are administered. Hence, in
studying the early history of Massachusetts
much important aid may be
derived from the records of the courts
and magistrates of that time. These
give us a tolerable correct idea of the
laws then in force which were designed
to regulate the conduct of men in the
various relations of life and show what
was the practical administration of
those laws. This is quite as true
(perhaps more so), of the laws concerning
what may be termed minor
offences or breaches of social duty, for
which men were held legally accountable,
as it is of the graver crimes.</p>

<p>Some of the laws relating to this class
of minor offences have undergone
changes within the last two hundred
years, particularly since our separation
from the Mother Country.</p>

<p>These changes have been not so
much in regard to the nature and description
of the offence itself, as in regard
to the penalty. They have in
Massachusetts at the present time, and
have had ever since the American Revolution,
laws against drunkenness,
vagrancy, petty larceny, libel and
slander, profane cursing and swearing,
Sabbath breaking, unlawful games
or plays, lewdness, common railing and
brawling, and idle and disorderly conduct
generally. Our Colonial ancestors
had laws substantially like those in
force so far as relates to the offences
themselves.</p>

<p>In fact, the present statutes on these
subjects are many of them copies of
the provincial statutes. But the penalties
are quite different. They now
punish breaching of these laws by a
small fine or by imprisonment for a
short term, or by both. For similar
breaches of the statute and common
law in the early history of Massachusetts
some very different penalties were
provided. These were actually enforced
in frequent instances, which is
hardly true of similar cases at the
present day.</p>

<p>The Magistrates and Courts that
administered the laws in Massachusetts
during the first century and a half
after its settlement were full believers
in the propriety and efficacy of corporal
punishment for a certain class of
transgressions. Having based their
criminal code largely upon that of
Moses, they were well persuaded that,
if in no case they exceeded the Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
limit of forty stripes, they would have
the Divine sanction. With this illustrious
precedent constantly in view as
a rule of action, they did not hesitate
to apply the rod whenever it seemed
to them appropriate and adequate
penalty for the offence. Crimes of a
graver character were dealt with by
tribunals of larger jurisdiction and
punished by imprisonment or death.
But for a large class of misdemeanors,
particularly such as were considered
scandalous or tending to
disorder and of evil example, the rod
was a very frequent instrument of punishment.</p>

<p>It was a matter within the discretion
of the Magistrate to some extent. This
office was held by William Pynehon,
of Springfield, Mass., for the first eleven
years, afterwards for half a century by
John Pynehon and his associates. In
awarding this punishment of whipping
little regard seems to have been paid
by the court to the sex or social position
of the offender. If the infliction
of the penalty tended to disgrace the
culprit, the commission of the offence
was in itself disgraceful. The degrading
punishment was regarded the just
and proper sequence of the disgraceful
crime.</p>

<p>The constable was the officer by
whom the sentence was executed, and
the public whipping post was the
place. The time was sometimes the
day on which the court was held.
Occasionally, the day of the weekly
religious lecture was designated as the
time for the infliction.</p>

<p>Sometimes whipping was an alternative
sentence to be inflicted if the
offender failed to pay his fine. Often
it was the only punishment awarded.</p>

<p>Some instances will be given, taken
from the records—most of them are
from the Pynehon record, containing
cases tried by William Pynehon as a
Magistrate, and cases tried by his son,
John Pynehon, in connection with
Eleziar Holyoke and Dr. Samuel Chapin
who were commissioners appointed by
the General Court.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">False Reports, Slanders, etc.</span></h3>

<p>In May, 1645, the General Court
enacted a law designed to suppress the
invention and circulation of false reports,
whether injurious to private individuals
or to the public in general.</p>

<p>The preamble was in these words:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Truth in words, as well
as actions, is required of all men, especially
of Christians who are the professed
servants of the God of truth;
and</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, All lying is contrary to
truth, and some sort of lies are not only
sinful (as all lies are), but also pernicious
to the public weal and injurious
to particular persons. It is therefore
ordered that every person who shall
wittingly and willingly make or publish
any lie pernicious to the public
weal or tending to the damage or injury
of any particular person, or with
intent to deceive and abuse the people
with false news and reports shall be
punished.</p>

<p>For the 1st offence a fine of 10
shillings, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>For the 2d offence a fine of 20
shillings or be whipped upon the
naked body not exceeding 10 stripes.</p>

<p>For the 3rd offence a fine of 4
shillings or 15 stripes, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>The following is a case for slander in
imputing to a woman the offence
witchcraft.</p>

<p>“May 29 and 30, 1649—The widdow
Marshfield, complains against Mary,
the wife of Hugh Parsons, of Springfield,
for reporting her to be suspected
for a witch, and she produced Jo Matthews
and his wife for her witnesses
who were examined upon oath. Jo
Matthews said that Mary Parsons told
him how she was taught to try a witch
by a widdow woman that now lives in
Springfield, and that she had lived in
Windsor, and that she had three children,
and that one of them was married,
and at last she said it was the
widdow Marshfield. Jo Matthews
answered that he believed no such
thing of her—but, thereupon, said he,
Mary Parsons replied, you need not
speak so much for goody Marshfield,
for I am sure (said she), she hath
envied every woman’s child in ye
end (?) till her own daughter had a
child, and then said she yt child died
and ye cow died, and I am persuaded
said she, they were bewitched, and
she said moreover, it was reported to
her by one in town that she was suspected
to be a witch when she lived
in Windsor, and that it was publicly
knowne that the devill followed her
house in Windsor, and for aught I
know said she follows her here.</p>

<p>Goody Matthews saith upon oath
that when Goody Parsons came to her
house she said to her, I wonder what
is become of the half pound of wool.
Goody Parsons said that she could not
tell except the witch had witched it
away. I wonder, said I, that you talk
so much of a witch—do you think there
is any witch in towne? Yes, said she,
and she came into my house while the
wool was cardinge. Who is it, said I?
She said that An Stebbinge had told her
in Mr. Smith’s chamber that she was
suspected to be a witch in Windsor,
and that there were divers strange
lights seen of late in the Meddow that
were never seen before ye widdow
Marshfield came to town, and that she
did grudge at other women that had
children because her daughter had
none, and about the time (namely of
the grudging) ye child died and ye cow
died.</p>

<p>Goody Parsons did stiffly deny the
truth of their testimonys, but the said
witness had delivered their testimony
upon oath, and finding that she had
defamed ye good name of the Widdow
Marshfield I sentenced her to be well
whipped on the morrow after lecture
with twenty lashes by the constable
unless she could promise the payment
of 3L to ye Widdow Marshfield for and
towards the reparation of her good
name.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marriage—Plymouth Colony Laws.—1638.</span></h3>

<p>“Whereas divers persons unfit for
marriage both in regard of their
young years and also in regard of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
weake estate, some practising the enveagling
of men’s daughters and maids
under guardines contrary to their
parents and guardians likeing, and of
maid servants without leave and liking
of their masters.</p>

<p>“It is therefore enacted by the Court
that if any shall make any motion of
marriage to any man’s daughter or
mayde servant not having first obtayned
leave and consent of the parents
or master so to doe, shall be punished
either by fine or corporal punishment
or both, at the discretion of the
bench and according to the nature of
the offence. It is also enacted that if
a motion of marriage be duly made to
the master, and through any sinister
end or coveteous desire he will not
consent thereunto, then the cause to
be made known unto the Magistrates
and they to set down such order therein
as upon examination of the case
shall appear to be most equal on both
parts.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Courtship and Marriage—Province Laws.</span></h3>

<p>“May 1647. Whereas God hath
committed the care and power into the
hands of parents for the disposing of
their children in marriage, so that it is
against rule to seek to draw away the
affection of young maidens under
pretence of purpose of marriage, before
their parents have given way and
allowance in that respect; and whereas
it is a common practice in divers
places for young men irregularly and
disorderly to watch all advantages for
their evil purposes to insinuate into
the affections of young maidens, by
coming to them in places and seasons
unknown to their parents for such
ends, whereby much evil hath grown
amongst us to the dishonor of God
and damage of parties; for prevention
whereof for time to come:</p>

<p>It is further ordered that whatsoever
person from henceforth shall endeavour,
directly or indirectly, to draw
away the affection of any maid in this
jurisdiction, under pretence of marriage,
before he hath obtained liberty
and allowance from her parents or
governors, or in the absence of such,
of the nearest magistrate, he shall
forfeit for the first offence five pounds,
for the second towards the party ten
pounds, and be bound to forbear any
further attempt and proceedings in
that unlawful design without or against
the allowance aforesaid; and for the
third offence upon information or
complaint by such parents or governors
to any Magistrate, giving bond to
prosecute the party, he shall be committed
to prison; and upon hearing
and conviction by the next court, shall
be adjudged to continue in prison
until the court of assistants shall see
fit to release him.”</p>

<p>In 1641, before this statute was enacted,
a case occurred which Mr.
Pynehon records, in which he sentenced
parties for the misconduct forbidden
by this statute. This must
have been under his general authority
to examine misdemeanors and
inflict corporal punishment.</p>

<p>“January 11, 1640, it is ordered that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
John Hobell shall be well whipt by
the constable for two misdemeanors,
first for proceeding to get promises of
marriage from Abigail Burt, after that
both he and she had been prohibited
by her father several times (and also
for offering and attempting to doe the
act of fornication with her as they
both confesse, though as far as we can
discerne by any proof of justice the
act was not done).</p>

<p>Also Abigail Burt is found guilty in
both the said faults, and is also to be
well whipt by the constable for the
said faults.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Railers and Brawlers</span> were
punishable by the old provincial laws
as they are by our present laws, but
in a different way. A curious case is
recorded by Mr. Holyoke as having
come before the courts at the time
John Pynehon, Samuel Chapin and
Eliziar Holyoke were the Magistrates.</p>

<p>“March 13, 1655—Obadiah Miller
complaynes against Joane, his wife,
for abusing him with reproachfull
tearmes or names as calling him foole,
toad, vermine and threateninge him;
as also for yt yesterday shee fell upon
him endeavoring to beat him, at which
tyme shee scratched his face and
hands. The case being examined it
was found that Joane, the wife of
Obadiah Miller was guilty of very evil
behavior towards her said husband;
it being proved by the testimony of
John Lamb and Tho. Miller.</p>

<p>John Lamb testifyed he heard her
say shee would knock him on the
head, and yt shee did often call him
foole and other reproachful tearmes.</p>

<p>Thomas Miller testifyed yt wn his
brother Obediah, his wife lived with
him she did comonly call him foole
and vermine; and he doth not remember
he ever heard her call him
husband, and that shee said shee did
not love him but hated him; yea shee
here said shee did not love him and
shee should not love him.</p>

<p>For which, her vile misbehaviour
towards her husband, she was adjudged
to be taken forth to ye whipping
post, there to receive soe many
stripes on ye naked body as ye commissioners
should see cause to inflict
on her; whereuppon shee was
brought forth, but by her humileation
and earnest protestations for better
carriage towards her said husband, the
punishment was remitted and this
sentence passed yt for the least miscarriage
to her husband after this
tyme, shee should be brought forth
agayne to receive a good whipping
on the naked body well laid on.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Husband or Wife Striking.</span></h3>

<p class="center">Colony Laws, Chap. 66.</p>

<p>October 1650. “It is ordered by
the Court and authority thereof, that
no man shall strike his wife, nor any
woman her husband, on penalty of
such fine not exceeding ten pounds
for one offence, or such corporall punishment
as the County Court shall determine.”</p>

<p>The Colony laws regarding the
<span class="smcap">Observance of the Sabbath</span> were quite
numerous and strictly enforced by
various penalties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>At a court before the Commissioners
John Pynehon, Eliziar Holyoke and
Samuel Chapin. May 8th, 1654.</p>

<p>“Daniel, a Scotchman servant to
Thomas Merick being found to profhane
the Sabbath in idle walkinge
about, and not cominge to ye ordinances
of ye Lord, yea though he had
warninge to ye contrary; and being
also complayned of by his said master
for his grevious idleness in neglecting
his busyness for severall dayes,
yea synce he was called before authority
for the like misbehaviour formerly
at wh tyme he promised amendment;
but he grew worse and worse and
therefore was adjudged to be whipped
on ye bare back wth five lashes well
laid on, and execution was done accordingly.”</p>

<p>Another case in which four young
men were charged with violation of
the Sabbath was attended with this
peculiarity—that two of the culprits
were sons of Holyoke, one of the two
Magistrates before whom the trial was
had.</p>

<p>This trial was in 1664, and was
thus recorded in the handwriting of
Holyoke.</p>

<p>“Thomas Noble, Constable, presenting
Thomas Thomson and John
Horton for that last Sabb., was fortnight,
June ye 7, they made a fray in
ye street in ye evening about ½ an
hour after sunsett. Samuel &amp; Elizar
Holyoke being accessory in ye said
fray.</p>

<p>The Commissioners uppon examination
of ye case doe fynd that the
said foure persons did profane the
Lord’s day, and therefor doe determine
that they all shall be admonished
thereof &amp; that Thomas Thomson,
John Horton, and Samuel Holyoke
shall pay a fyne of five shillings
apeece to the County, or be whipped
by the Constable on ye naked body
with three stripes apeece; whereuppon
they were all admonished &amp; the
3 former desiring to pay ye fynes, then
otherwise were ordered to pay them
to ye County Treasurer.”</p>

<p>Samuel Holyoke upon whom this
sentence was passed by his own father,
was then a boy of seventeen
years. Twelve years afterwards in
1676, he was the Capt. Holyoke who
so greatly distinguished himself in
the celebrated Falls fight with the
Indians.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Assaulting of Women.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Province Laws Ch. 105-1711.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> And be it further enacted by
the authority aforesaid, that whosoever
shall be convicted of assaulting
or offering any insolence or violence
to any woman or mankind in the fields,
streets or lanes in any town, or of despoiling
them, damnifying or defacing
of their attire or ornaments, or attempting
the same, shall be punished
by being publickly whipped, not exceeding
two stripes, or by being committed
to the house of correction to receive
the discipline of the house and
continue there by the space of thirty
days.</p>

<p>The discipline of the house by a law
passed in 1699, included among other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
things, “moderate whipping not exceeding
ten stripes at once, which shall
be inflicted at their first coming in and
from time to time, in case they be
stubborn, disorderly or idle.”</p>

<p>(At a Court holden at Northampton,
June 19, 1672, John Edwards, of Northampton,
who came to that place from
Virginia, was tried for some misdemeanor
in lascivious carriage towards
divers women of Northampton, and
the case being searched into. It is
found and proved yt the sd Edwards
hath been notoriously lascivious and
hath carried himself very debauchedly
towards diverse women of N (as by
test on file appears) and yt he hathe
traded? this way:)</p>

<p>“The Courte doth adjudge him to be
whipt on ye naked body with 20 stripes
well laid on.”</p>

<p>A different case with a different
penalty is this. At a County Corte
holden at Northampton, March 31,
1674.</p>

<p>“Martin Smith, resident at Pacomtuck,
being bound over to this Corte
by N. Comiss: for offering abuse to
Jedidiak Strong’s wife (in ye street near
her father Woodwards house) laying
hold on her to kiss her as shee thinks,
and she testifying her offence to be
soe affronted whereby shee sayth also
shee was somewhat affrighted; he appearing
in Corte and owning his fact
and condemning himself and seeming
sorrowful that he should be left to
such folly, was fyned only 20s. to be
pd to ye Treasurer and 2s. and 6d. as
ye Recorder’s fees.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sitting in the Stocks</span> was a mode
of punishment for certain offences to
which persons of either sex were sometimes
subjected. Occasionally it was
ordered as an alternative sentence in a
case where the culprit failed to pay
the fine imposed.</p>

<p>Webster’s Unabridged describes the
stocks as a machine consisting of a
frame of timber, with holes in which
the feet, or the feet and hands of the
criminals were confined by way of
punishment. The picture gives a
much better idea of this punishment
than can be gained from the
definition. The offender sits on a
bench with a high back, his feet projecting
through two holes in an upright
plank in front secured so that
they cannot be withdrawn or moved.
In this situation he can neither lie
down or stand up, but must remain
fixed until released. The stocks were
usually located in some public place
where the culprit could be seen by all
passers by—and not seldom he was
subjected to the taunts and ridicule
of the crowd that were sure to gather
on such an occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Profane Cursing and Swearing</span> was
one of the offences subjecting the transgressor
to the punishment of the
stocks.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Colony Laws, Chap. 94.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Act Against Swearing and Cursing.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 1.</span> It is ordered by this Court
and authority thereof, that if any person
within this jurisdiction shall swear
rashly or vainly by the holy name of
God, or other oath, he shall forfeit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the common treasury for every such
offence ten shillings; and it shall be in
the power of any Magistrate by warrant
to the constable, to call such person
before him, and upon sufficient
proof to sentence such offender, and to
give order to levy the fine; and if such
person be not able or shall refuse to
pay the said fine, he shall be committed
to the stocks, there to continue
not exceeding three hours nor less than
one hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> And if any person shall
swear more oaths than one at a time
before he remove out of the room or
company where he so swears, he shall
then pay 20 shillings. The like penalty
shall be inflicted for profane and
wicked cursing of any person or creature,
and for the multiplying the same
as is appointed for profane swearing,
and in case any person so offending by
multiplying oaths or cursing, shall not
pay his or their fines forthwith, they
shall be whipt or committed to prison
till they shall pay the same at the discretion
of the Court or Magistrate that
shall have cognyance thereof.”</p>

<p>The wife of Henry Gregory, one of
the early settlers here, transgressed
this law, and her case came before
Mr. William Pynehon as a Magistrate.
His record of it is as follows under
date of February 15, 1640:</p>

<p>“Goody Gregory being accused by
oath of John Woodcoke &amp; Richard
Williams for swearing before God I
could break thy head: She did acknowledge
it was her great sin &amp; fault
&amp; saith she hath bin much humbled for
it.</p>

<p>She is fined 12d (12 pence) to the
poore to be paid to Henry Smyth within
a month; or if she doe not she is
to sit 3 hours in the stocks.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Common Scold.</span></h3>

<p>By the English common law in force
here in the early times a common scold
was liable to a peculiar form of punishment.
Blackstone (4 Black. Com.
168) says:</p>

<p>“A common scold—communis rixatrix—(for
our law confines it to the
feminine gender) is a public nuisance
to her neighborhood for which offence
she may be indicted, and if convicted
shall be sentenced to be placed in a
certain engine of correction called the
trebucket, castigatory or cucking stool,
which in the Saxon language is said to
signify the scolding stool, though now
it is frequently corrupted into ducking
stool, because the residue of the judgment
is that when she is placed therein
she shall be plunged in the water for
her punishment.”</p>

<p>Oct. 24, 1673—“John Petty complaines
agt Goodwife Hunter for offering
to mischiefe his wife &amp; giving her
ill language; calling her as ye testimonys
speake:</p>

<p>Railing, scolding &amp; other exorbitancys
of ye Young appearing as by ye
Testimonys of Mary Brookes &amp; Mercy
Johns on file &amp; also ye neighbors, declaring
her continual trade upon every
occasion to be exorbitant in her Toung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
as particularly Sam Marshfull &amp; John
Bagg so declared. I sentenced her to
be gaged or else set on a ducking

Shee to choose wh of ym shee

Goodie Petty shoe did openly
cleare her of all shee spake agt her &amp;
asked forgiveness wch G. Petty accepting

<p>The Puritan Fathers are often blamed
on account of their witchcraft persecutions.
Long after Massachusetts
had confessed her wrong-doing, England
and Germany put people to death
for witchcraft. Twenty-five years after
persecution had ceased in New England,
Chief Justice Matthew Hale, of
England, sent a mother and her little
daughter to the scaffold for the same
offence; and one hundred and one
years afterwards Germany did likewise.
The age in which these men
lived is responsible for these things,
and not the men themselves. They
were founders of schools, and were not
intolerant. I do not believe in the cry
of the “good old times” simply.
There are more good men and women
now than ever before. I think it almost
unfortunate to explain away witchcraft
and some other peculiar things of those
times, as then some people would have
nothing to talk about and sneer at and
criticise the Pilgrim Fathers. Some persons
like to continue this. Dr. Blake of
Boston, says that a good Baptist brother
had often met him and chaffingly asked,
“How is Roger Williams to-day?”
when Mr. Blake, tiring of the question,
answered, “Oh, he is warm and dry by
this time.” The Pilgrims had especially
three noble qualities: Earnestness,
definiteness of belief and stalwartness
of spiritual life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GENERAL_WILLIAM_EMERSON_STRONG">GENERAL WILLIAM EMERSON STRONG.</h2>

</div>

<p>With the death of General William
E. Strong of Chicago, in April of the
present year, there passed away another
of the distinguished volunteer
soldiers of the United States who
won distinction during the War of the
Rebellion, and at the close of that
great conflict returned to civil life to
become the flower of American manhood,
and a perfect representative of
American citizenship. Brave, loyal
and patriotic, when the call came for
his services in support of the Union
he was prompt to respond, and was a
faithful and gallant soldier until the
struggle was ended and victory
achieved. When that time came it
found him equally ready to return to
peaceful pursuits in which in later
years his high character and ability
made him both successful and distinguished.</p>

<p>William Emerson Strong was born
in Granville, in Washington County,
New York, August 10, 1840. The
family to which he belonged was one
of the oldest and most noted of the
Puritan families of New England.
Elder John Strong, the founder of the
family in America, was a native of
Taunton, England—where his ancestors
had been honorably mentioned in
public records as long ago as 1545.
He sailed from Plymouth in the ship
“Mary and John,” March 20th, 1630,
in company with one hundred and
forty other persons. They landed at
Nantasket, (twelve miles s. e. of Boston)
at the end of a voyage of more
than seventy days, and John Strong
settled at Northampton, Massachusetts.
Here several generations of his
descendants lived, and from thence
representatives of the family drifted
into other States, to become conspicuous
in all the walks of life.</p>

<p>One of these descendants, but three
or four generations removed from the
pilgrim John Strong was Caleb Strong,
one of the framers of the Federal Constitution,
Governor of Massachusetts
from 1800 to 1807, and again from
1812 to 1816, and also one of the first
United States Senators from the “Old
Bay State.”</p>

<p>Other representatives of the family
who have achieved extraordinary distinction
have been Gen. George C.
Strong, who was mortally wounded
while leading the Federal troops in the
assault on Fort Wagner, July 18th,
1863, Rear Admiral James Hooker
Strong of the United States Navy,
Theron R. Strong, at one time a Judge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
of the Supreme Court of New York
State, William Strong one of the most
noted of American jurists, and Simeon
Strong, who sat on the Supreme Court
Bench of Massachusetts from 1800 to
1805.</p>

<p>General William E. Strong was descended
on the father’s side from the
Emerson family of New England, one
of his near kinsmen being Ralph
Waldo Emerson, the poet-philosopher,
whose name is revered by all those
who appreciate the purest and best in
intellectual culture.</p>

<p>Gen. Strong’s father, John Emerson
Strong, was a wealthy manufacturer
and merchant of Granville, New York,
up to 1849, when he met with business
reverses which changed the character
of his business and led him to seek a
new location. In the spring of 1853
he removed from New York to Wisconsin,
and settled with his family at
Jefferson Prairie, in Rock County,
where he purchased a farm and turned
his attention to bringing it under cultivation.
His son William was at this
time thirteen years of age. Prior to
the removal of the family from New
York he had enjoyed all the educational
advantages afforded by the
excellent schools of the town in which
he had lived and had made good progress
in his studies. From the time
he was thirteen until he was seventeen
years of age however, he was busily
employed at work on his father’s farm
and only attended school during the
winter months of each year with the
exception of one year, when he had
the privilege of spending six months
in the preparatory department of
Beloit College.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1856 when he was in
his seventeenth year, he entered the
law office of Strong &amp; Fuller, at Racine,
Wisconsin, and under their preceptorship
began the study of law.
He was at that time an active, manly
young fellow, and he entered upon the
work of fitting himself for a professional
career with all the ardor, enthusiasm
and determination which
characterized him in later years.
Whatever he undertook to do, he endeavored
to do better than it had been
done before. In everything he strove
to excel, and in this he observed the
spirit of the old motto “Tentanda est
Via,” placed upon the Strong escutcheon
three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>After a time he temporarily dropped
his law studies and went to Phillips
Academy at Andover, Massachusetts,
where he prepared for college and was
admitted to the sophomore class of
Harvard. Before completing his college
course however, he determined
to enter upon the practice of law, and
in accordance with the course he had
mapped out for himself, he made application
for admission to the bar of
Wisconsin. He was examined at
Racine, in open court, by a committee
appointed for the purpose in accordance
with the usages of that period,
and the examination being passed
successfully he was duly authorized to
begin practicing his profession in the
courts of the First Judicial Circuit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Wisconsin. This was in 1861, and it
will be observed that notwithstanding
the fact that he had had to contend
with disadvantages of various kinds,
before he was twenty-one years of
age he had fitted himself to enter the
profession in which so large a number
of those bearing the same name and
belonging to the same stock had
achieved unusual distinction.</p>

<p>The day he received the certificate
which entitled him to begin the practice
of law, was that which brought
the news of the fall of Fort Sumpter.
This suddenly changed all his plans,
and ultimately the whole course of his
life. At once he resolved to tender
his services to the government, and on
the same day that President Lincoln
issued his first call for volunteers, he
was regularly enlisted in the government
service. He proceeded to raise
a company, known as the Belle City
Rifles, which was assigned to the
Second Regiment of Wisconsin Infantry.
When the company was
organized, William E. Strong was commissioned
Captain and went into the
field in command of it, the regiment
becoming part of a brigade commanded
by Colonel (afterward General)
W. T. Sherman. He retained
the command of the company between
four and five months, participating
in the battle of Blackburn’s Fort and
Bull Run. He was also in command
of his company when the next advance
of the army into Virginia was made by
way of Chain Ridge. It was during
his first campaign that Captain Strong
met with one of his most thrilling experiences,
and demonstrated that his
fighting qualities were such as could
be depended upon under all circumstances.
At one time while extending
his picket line, he ventured too far out
and found himself inside the lines of
the enemy. Before he could retire
from this embarrassing and dangerous
position he was surrounded by a band
of five confederates, three of whom
were mounted and two of whom were
on foot, and was taken prisoner. The
confederates demanded his pistols,
and with great courtesy and suavity
he responded “certainly gentlemen,”
at the same time drawing the weapons
from their holsters. His “suaviter in
modo” threw his enemies off their
guard, but he had no intention of
being captured without a struggle,
and no sooner were the pistols in his
hands than they were brought to bear
on the confederates and two of them
fell at his first fire. The suddenness
and vigor of the attack caused the
remaining captors to beat a retreat,
and Captain Strong reached the Federal
lines in safety. In this encounter
he was shot through the cheek, but
although the wound was painful he
did not regard it as serious and did
not allow it to interfere with his regular
discharge of his military duties.</p>

<p>On the 12th of September he was
commissioned Major of the 12th. Regiment
of Wisconsin Infantry, serving
with it in Kansas, Missouri, and New
Mexico. In October of 1862, he was
assigned to duty on the staff of General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
McLean, as Inspector General of
the first division, right wing of the
Army of the Tennessee. He served in
this capacity two months and was then
assigned to duty on the staff of General
James B. McPherson, as inspector General
of the right wing of the Army of
the Tennessee. In February, 1863, he
was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel
and became Assistant Inspector General
of the Seventeenth Army corps.
On the 20th of April, 1864, he was appointed
Inspector General of the Department
and Army of the Tennessee,
serving in that capacity until the close
of the war. He was chief of staff to
General O. O. Howard, on the march
to the sea and through the Carolinas
to Beaufort, Goldboro, Raleigh and
thence to Washington. At Atlanta he
was promoted to a Colonelcy, dating
from July 22d, 1864, for “gallantry on
the field of battle,” and on the 21st of
March, 1865, he was brevetted a brigadier
general of volunteers, having attained
this distinction while still under
24 years of age.</p>

<p>After participating in the grand review
of troops at Washington in May,
1865, General Strong was assigned
with General Howard, to duty in connection
with the conduct and management
of the Freedman’s Bureau,
and in September, 1866, was then
mustered out of the service at his own
request, having served in all over five
years.</p>

<p>Throughout his entire term of service
he was recognized as a brave and
capable officer, and his gallantry was
attested on numerous occasions. It
was he who raised the stars and stripes
over the Courthouse at Vicksburg immediately
after the capitulation of the
confederate forces.</p>

<p>He received the last order from the
brilliant and lamented McPherson,
while acting as his chief of staff, and
led the desperate and daring charge
which was made to recover the dead
chieftain’s body. The following is a
list of battles and campaigns in which
he participated; The battles of Blackburn’s
Ford and Bull Run in July,
1861. The campaign in Kansas, and
also the campaign in Kentucky, Tennessee
and Central Mississippi in
1862-63; the campaign against Vicksburg
by way of the Mississippi River;
and also in the battles of Port Gibson,
May 1st; battle of Raymond, May
12th; battle of Jackson, May 14th;
battle of Champign Hills, May 16th;
battle of Black River Bridge, May 17th;
Siege of Vicksburgh, May 17th to July
4th, 1863; the campaign against Meridian,
Mississippi, and that against
Atlanta in 1864, in which he participated
in the battle of Resaca, Dallas,
New Hope Church, Kennesaw Mountain,
Atlanta, Ezra Chapel, Jonesboro,
Lovejoy Station, and later Fort McAllister,
and Bentonville, one of the
final contests of the war, and was
present at the final surrender of Johnston’s
army on April 26th of that year.
Esteemed by his superior officers and
subordinates alike for his soldierly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
qualities, he was equally noted for his
uniform courtesy and his efficiency as
an executive officer.</p>

<p>In 1867, soon after he left the military
service, General Strong formed
a business connection with the Peshtigo
Company, one of the largest corporate
organizations engaged in the
lumber trade in the United States. The
same year he was married to Miss
Mary Bostwick Ogden, an accomplished
young woman, daughter of
Mahlon D. Ogden, one of the pioneer
citizens of Chicago. Establishing his
home in Chicago at that time it continued
to be his place of residence to
the date of his death, and with many
of its most important enterprises and
undertakings of late years he was
most prominently identified. Chosen
secretary and treasurer of the Peshtigo
Company in 1867, he retained that
position until 1873, when he became
president of the corporation. This
position he filled for eighteen years,
and was holding at the time of his
death, April 10th, 1891. He was one
of the promoters and builders of the
Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal, became a
director and was also treasurer and
assistant secretary of the Sturgeon
Bay &amp; Lake Michigan Canal Company,
and was largely instrumental in developing
the resources of the lumber
regions of the northwest. In his business
life he showed great capacity for
the conduct of affairs of more than
ordinary magnitude. His management
of the important interests committed
to his care was uniformally successful.
He never lost his interest in military
affairs, and after he became a citizen
of Illinois was among those most
active in promoting the organization
and providing for the proper discipline
and equipment of the National Guard
of the State. In 1876, he was commissioned
by Gov. Beveridge, Inspector
General of the Illinois’ National
Guard. Gov. Cullom, the immediate
successor of Gov. Beveridge, commissioned
him Inspector General and Inspector
of Rifle practice on his staff,
with the rank of Brigadier General in
1877, and again in 1879. In addition
to his interest in the National Guard,
he was active in building up and promoting
the growth of the veteran organizations
particularly of the Military
Order of the Loyal Legion, of the Illinois
commandery of which he was a
charter member and also commander.</p>

<p>In politics he took a moderately
active interest as a member of the
Republican party to the principles of
which he was devotedly attached. He
was a member of the Local Committee
of Arrangements which had charge of
the preparations for the meeting of the
National Republican convention of
1880, was designated to take charge
of the convention building, and to act
as sergeant-at-arms after the sessions
began. This convention was memorable
for the length of time it lasted, for
the large number of distinguished men
who participated in the proceedings,
and the multitude of people from all
parts of the country in attendance.
The great crowds were handled by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
General Strong with remarkable skill,
and at the close of the convention he
was publicly thanked for his services
by General James A. Garfield, who
had been made the Presidential nominee.</p>

<p>From early boyhood General Strong
was a lover of field sports, and was
passionately found of hunting wild
fowl and large game, and visited at
one time and another, almost every
portion of the United States, having
attractions of this kind to offer. In
company with General Phil. Sheridan—for
many years, one of his most intimate
friends—he made several visits
to the Yellowstone Park region, and
wrote numerous interesting sketches of
these experiences, adventures and explorations.
While the busy life he led
did not allow him to give as much attention
as he would have liked to literature,
he gathered together a valuable
library, one of the most conspicuous
features of which was the amount of
war literature which it contained, inclusive
of rare manuscripts, autograph
letters, papers, documents, and photographs,
which it is said can scarcely
be duplicated in the United States. He
was a member of the Literary Club of
Chicago and also of the Commercial
Club. His last public service was
rendered to the city in the capacity of
a director of the Worlds Fair, an enterprise
with the inception and inauguration
of which he had much to do.</p>

<p>General Strong was in the prime of a
splendid manhood when failing health
admonished him that he must seek rest
and a change of climate. Accordingly
on the 14th of March last, he sailed
from New York to join his wife and
daughters in Europe. Traveling by
easy stages he reached Florence, Italy,
where the end came suddenly, and at
least to his thousands of friends in the
United States, unexpectedly on the 10th
of April. His remains were brought
back to the land of his nativity and to
his former home in Chicago. From
thence they were carried by the comrades
of former days and the devoted
friends of his later years to his last
resting place in Graceland cemetery,
where he sleeps peacefully, wrapped
in the national colors which he so
bravely defended in his young manhood.</p>

<p>At the obsequies of General Strong
the fact was made apparent that a
man had passed away whom a great
busy community, felt called upon to
honor, and the tenderest tributes of
love, respect, and admiration were
laid on his grave. Said one who paid
tribute to his character and worth as
a man and patriot: “It is befitting to
preserve in memory and hand down to
the generations something about a man
who has helped to make citizens heroic
soldiers, and to render possible the
triumph of liberty and manhood.
While his was a beneficent existence
of many manly years, it seems to the
view of man that he died before his
time. It is but just to say of him that
his conduct as a soldier, sprang from
a truly patriotic, martyr spirit which
enabled him to dare unflinchingly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
with a smile to the green earth, and a
smile to the bright heavens, and a
cheer to his companions.”</p>

<p>Of striking appearance, pleasing
manners and great personal magnetism,
he drew around him a circle of
friends which was composed of many
of the men best known in public and
official life, in the world of trade and
commerce, and in the various professions.
These men were drawn to him
by his geniality, his candor, his culture,
his broad liberality and his unswerving
fidelity to his friends. He
was of that chivalrous nature which
was regarded as the distinguishing
characteristic of the Preux Chevalier
in the days of knight errantry and
with it all, was the practical, level-headed
man of affairs.</p>

<p>A brave soldier, a good citizen, a
courteous gentleman, General Strong
was a splendid type of American manhood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MISTAKES_IN_HISTORY">MISTAKES IN HISTORY—THE PILGRIMS NOT PURITANS BUT SEPARATISTS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Among the wrong impressions and
mistaken ideas which have been conveyed
by writers and speakers during
the last two hundred and fifty years,
and even down to the present day,
there are, perhaps, none more prominent
and important than those relating
to, and connected with, that most
interesting body of people and most
important event in our history—the
Pilgrims and their coming to America.
In no instance that is now called to
mind, of the settling of a country or
planting of a colony, have the motives
and purposes of the colonists been so
misrepresented and falsified, and so
much fiction made to hang about their
acts, as in the case of the Pilgrims. It
is proposed in the present article to
deal with two main ideas—who were
the Pilgrims, and what were their objects
or motives in coming to this
country.</p>

<p>With regard to the first idea there
seems to be great and unpardonable
ignorance and confusion, for they were
not Puritans nor Persecutors, as the
latter became both in England and
early in America, but were Separatists.
Much has been done by Mr. Benjamin
Scott, Chamberlain of the City of
London, towards setting this matter
right and putting it in proper shape
before the public, and, he in turn,
obtained much information through
the studies and investigations of Dr.
Waddington. The latter says: “The
ignorance still existing on this subject
is almost incredible. We find men of
education who seem to have no exact
information respecting the Pilgrim
Fathers. Quarterly reviewers, members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
of Parliament, Christian divines
and ecclesiastical historians speak of
them with the same complacent disregard
of facts.” The church presumed
to dictate as to what kind of christians
the Puritans should be, and the form
and manner of worship they should
adopt and be governed by. To these
requirements there was a partial submission.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims separated from them
because of this church imposition, and
so became “Separatists.” Parliament
declared, in Mary’s reign, the Pope to
be the spiritual head of the church in
England. When Elizabeth ascended
to the throne 1558, she was confronted
with this state of affairs respecting
these matters, and issued a proclamation
forbidding any change in the forms
of religion, until they should be determined
according to law. Thus it happened
that there was no freedom to
worship according to conscience for
either Roman Catholics or Protestants.
Elizabeth was opposed to Popery, but
she was just as vindictive toward
Protestants who did not shape their
religious course and belief in accordance
with her standard and the law
of the State.</p>

<p>This Act of Supremacy, which she
caused to be passed soon after she
came into power, was not long after
followed by the Act of Uniformity,
which required everybody to worship,
not only as the State directed, but also
in the parish churches. Two years
later came the crowning act in the
adoption of the Articles of Religion;
and the Church of England was established
by the highest authority of the
realm, and then commenced separations
and persecutions. There were
a few people, a small band, who found
some errors yet left in the wake of the
Reformation against which they protested.
They also objected to any
human power assuming that headship
which they claimed belonged alone to
Christ, and also asked the privilege of
worshiping according to the simplicity
of form and practice of the primitive
Christians. Minor questions, such as
baptism and the like, which have since
given rise to divisions and sects, were
not considered, and this little band of
people, together with the Roman
Catholics, were the only persons
throughout England who objected to
the church as the law had established
it. Accordingly they formed themselves
into distinct bodies, or associations,
or churches, chose their own
teachers and determined their own
affairs. They claimed that the church
was a spiritual association and should,
therefore, be separated from the
world, and was amenable only to the
laws of Christ as given in the New
Testament. Hence the name “Separatists.”
They were simple in their
manners and conduct and morals, and
all these things rendered them unpopular
and drew upon them the ill-will
and enmity of the church, which
found plenty of reason and many
excuses and opportunities for persecuting
them. There arose at this period
another party, some of whom were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
English reformers, who had been
driven from the country and had returned
on the ascension of Elizabeth,
but were disappointed to find that
religious matters and laws had been
settled and established.</p>

<p>Many of them however, accepted
the change, including Royal Supremacy,
Uniformity of Worship and Articles
of Religion. They were nevertheless
much dissatisfied, but hoped to
effect still further changes and reformations.
But in this they failed.
This as will be seen, was a party
within a party, a church within a
church, or a party within the “establishment,”
and they were the “Puritans.”
In other words, the Protestants
may be said to have been divided into
three classes. The High Ritualists,
Puritans and Separatists. High
Ritualists claimed divine authority for
the form of government, and the ceremonial
of the Church of England.
The king, they claimed, was the head
of the church, as well as supreme in
all civil matters and had power and
authority over persons and property.
The Puritans, on the contrary, believed
none of these doctrines, although they
were as devoted to the Church of
England as was the other party, the
High Ritualists, and the reforms they
desired, they sought to make from
within the church. Separation they
regarded as the rankest kind of an
offense, a terrible sin. To draw a
comparison, or to make an illustration—the
Puritans were Episcopalians—the
low-church wing of that period.
In another sense there was a difference
or distinction between Puritans and
Pilgrims: The Puritans had among
their number, as influential persons,
many of the nobility, men of business,
capitalists and educated, fashionable
and accomplished people. Indeed,
during the entire reign of James I, they
formed a majority in the House of
Commons, and no person not a communicant
of the Church of England
could then sit in that body.</p>

<p>From this body of Puritan Episcopalians
sprang that company who
landed at Salem and settled at Boston
in 1630, not the Pilgrims who settled
at Plymouth in 1620. The latter, the
“Separatists,” renounced the Church
of England, and separated from it.
They were likewise socially from the
humbler walks of life. Some of their
number, it is true, were persons of
education, culture and refinement, but
as has been said, the great bulk were
from among the common people, without
means, power or influence. Indeed,
they sustained about the same
relation to other classes and denominations
that the Methodists, in their beginning,
did to other religious denominations.
In short, they were persecuted
by the Church of England by the
Puritans and by the Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>The Separatists, one and all, suffered
every indignity, privation and want,
while many, among them Barrow,
Greenwood, Dennis and Penry, were
hung. Others still were thrown into
prison, and died from neglect, hunger
and cold. Others were permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
leave the country, but were informed
that if they returned, their lives would
be the forfeit. Later on, this was even
denied them, and their departure from
the country was forbidden. For these
reasons, the Separatist congregations
fled secretly to Holland, and even
in Holland the Dutch shunned them,
for they were afraid of offending King
James, whose good will and help they
wanted. These “Separatists,” or
Pilgrims, therefore gradually disappeared
from English soil, and from the
English mind, and in 1607, there remained
in the kingdom only one organized
congregation of this kind,
which was within the limits of the
little town of Scrooby. Here their
pastors were Richard Clifton and John
Robinson, the latter a somewhat rash
and inconsiderate young man, but
they depended chiefly for material aid
and favors, as well as sympathy and
encouragement, on William Brewster,
afterwards their “venerated elder.”
He was postmaster, and his duties included
the charge of public travel,
which necessitated a house of large
dimensions, and in this building he
permitted the “Separatists” to worship
weekly, lodging and entertaining
them. About this time there appeared
another person, a mere lad, who became
interested in, and identified himself
with, the Pilgrims, and who subsequently
occupied a useful and
prominent position in their history.</p>

<p>This was William Bradford, who
came from a very respectable family
in a neighboring village. They were
not long, however, to remain here in
peace and unmolested quiet. Their
retreat was sought out and persecutions
anew visited upon them, and
there remained only two alternatives,
the one to yield a hypocritical conformity
and submission, or to become
exiles from their native land, from
“the graves in which their fathers
slept.” They accordingly gathered
themselves together, and under the
leadership of the youthful and brave
Bradford, fled to Amsterdam—Brewster,
Robinson and Clifton remaining
behind, like the marshal of Napoleon’s
grand army, to guard the rear, when,
having seen all safely on their journey
and beyond the reach of the “King’s
hirelings,” they followed on and soon
joined those who had gone before.
They were disappointed however,
and failed to find peace and quiet and
rest, for at Amsterdam there were two
societies or congregations of English
worshipers who had fled their country,
but they were in continual dissensions
with each other, and rendered the
situation of the little band of “Separatists,”
uncomfortable and unpleasant.
There remained therefore, nothing for
the latter to do but to “move on,”
which they did, forty miles distant to
the “goodly and pleasant city” of
Leyden. Here at last they found
peace and quiet and freedom of worship,
but were not without perplexities
and disadvantages.</p>

<p>They had to depend upon manual
labor for subsistence, which employment
they sought from the Dutch, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
whose language they understood not
a word. In their own land they had
been chiefly agriculturists, but many
of them now became manufacturers
and mechanics of various kinds. Thus
were they, by the force of circumstances,
fortunate in learning trades
which were useful to the community
in after years in their home beyond
the sea. Bradford engaged in the silk
dyeing business and Brewster set up
a printing office. It could not be
expected that this condition of affairs,
even, although a great improvement,
would long satisfy the spiritual and
intellectual longings and demands of
such men as the Pilgrims. Their life,
on the whole, was far from satisfactory.
True their numbers had more
than doubled, grown from one to over
two hundred, yet their lot here seemed
to have been cast in a hard place.
Their children were losing English
habits, character and language. Sunday,
as was generally the case in
European countries, was a day of
recreation and was given up to merry-making
and the playing of games.
Influences, associations and examples
were unfortunate, and all these things
caused serious apprehensions in the
minds of the Pilgrims. The old adage,
too, that “a rolling stone gathers no
moss,” was strikingly illustrated in
their case. Years and life were passing
rapidly away.</p>

<p>They had, many of them, become
physically weakened from the hardships
they had endured and were
nearing old age, Brewster being sixty
at the time of the landing, and they
had the very natural feeling and desire
to “lay up something for a rainy day.”
After much thoughtful and prayerful
consideration, in view of all these facts
and circumstances, they decided to
emigrate to America.</p>

<p>At this period in their lives, from
their wanderings, misfortunes and
persecutions, nearly every member of
the Separatist-Pilgrim Company had
become reduced to the direst straits.
Indeed, this had been the common lot
and experience of a large majority of
them from their youth up, and when
it was determined to seek homes in
the new world, they were without
means to secure their passage.</p>

<p>To obtain this, they made the best
terms and conditions that they could
with the London merchants.</p>

<p>The conditions were hard, but they
were in the power of the merchants
and there was no alternative. Concerning
this Mr. Cushman who, acted
as agent in the matter, says: “Although
they (the proposals) were very
afflictive to the minds of such as were
concerned in the voyage, and hard
enough for the poor people that were
to adventure their persons as well as
their estates,” they had to be accepted.
Had they not done so, Mr. Cushman
adds, “the whole design would have
fallen to the ground.”</p>

<p>At the end of the seven years all
the original and acquired assets of
the colony, were to be equally divided
between the merchants and the Pilgrims.
So practically, it cost the Pilgrims<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
seven years of severe labor to
get from England to America. Nor
was this all. There had been disaffection
among the merchants and some
had withdrawn from the co-partnership,
leaving an accumulation of
indebtedness. Those remaining friendly
to the Pilgrims, wrote the latter:
“As there has been a faction among us
more than two years, so now there is
an utter breach and sequestration.
The company’s debts are no less than
1400 pounds, and we hope you will
do your best to free them. We are
still persuaded that you are the people
that must make a plantation in
those remote places where all others
fail. We have sent some cattle,
clothes, hoes, shoes, leather etc., for
Allerton and Winslow to sell as our
factors.”</p>

<p>And these goods the Pilgrims were
to purchase at an advance of seventy
per cent. Thus matters went from
bad to worse, until the Pilgrims, seeing
no way of “making out” of the
difficulty became convinced that the
best thing they could do was to break
up the co-partnership and wind up its
affairs. With this in view, they sent
Miles Standish to London to “oblige
them to come to a composition.” He
took up 150 pounds of the indebtedness
at the rate of fifty per cent.</p>

<p>Matters were in bad shape in England
for the colonists, and among
disheartening things, Standish found
that both Robinson and Cushman had
died. Finally, late in 1626, Mr. Allerton
went over and through influence
brought to bear on the merchants, the
latter agreed to sell out to the colonists
for 1,800 pounds, in payments of 200
pounds a year, beginning with the
year 1628. Here were nine years
more of hard labor before they could
hope to be clear of the indebtedness
incurred for their passage money
with living expenses added. An arrangement
was at last affected by
some of the leading men of the colony
with a few staunch friends in
London to take the trade of the colony
for six years, pay off the debts and
send the remainder of the Leyden
church over. The six years would
end in 1632, a period of twelve years
from the time of landing. It was also
the length of time spent by the Separatists
in Holland after they left England.
What a history! Almost a
generation in time, and crowded full
of trials, hardships, discouragements,
sickness and death.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims doubtless were a kind,
tender hearted and sympathetic people
naturally, and their surroundings
and experiences in life would tend to
render more marked these characteristics.
They as clearly were a christian
people and deeply religious, and
it could hardly be expected that the
Reformation of the sixteenth century,
setting men’s minds and thoughts religiously
free, would result in aught
else than great diversity of opinion,
and that beliefs and doctrines would
be sharply outlined and stoutly maintained;
Luther died but a few years
before Brewster was born, and Melanchthon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
his coadjutor and ally, lived
for several years after. Bradford and
Robinson were born before religious
feeling and ardor had become cooled.
It is not, therefore, a matter of surprise,
when we find Robinson taking
a hand in the discussions of the day.
This suited his nature; he seemed to
be in his “element,” for he was yet
young, only 32, when the “Separatists,”
went from Scrooby into Holland.</p>

<p>Lest it be thought that the opinion
we have expressed concerning Robinson
was incorrect and unjust,
the language is here given of an eminent,
English writer and speaker:
“It was with the Calvinists that Robinson
took part, entering into the subject
with all the learning of which he
was master and all the ardor of a man
of his temperament, and still not 40
years old. It is to be regretted that,
like all the other polemics of his day,
his zeal betrayed him into intemperate
warmth, and the adoption of harsh,
acrimonious and uncharitable expressions.
It must be remembered that
the most vehement, violent and vituperative
language used by the most
ultra bigot of our times is as mild as
milk, compared with the controversial
tone of the theological disputants of
the seventeenth century.” Bradford
also says of Robinson that “he was a
man of quick and sharp wit, an acute
and expert disputant, very quick and
ready;” and Winslow adds: “’Tis
true, I confess, he was more rigid in
his course and way at first than towards
his latter end,” when the
“fiery vehemence of youth” had
given place to the cooler judgment
and conservatism of riper years. But
Robinson did not come to America
with the Pilgrims, nor at all, for he
died at the age of 49, in 1625.</p>

<p>He had expected to come, but a
majority of the flock at Leyden decided
to remain at that place instead
of emigrating, and he concluded to
remain also.</p>

<p>Leaving Robinson out, who had
been obliged in early manhood, to resort
to daily labor for a living, it is
very doubtful if the desire for freedom
in religious worship was the main
motive for their emigrating.</p>

<p>Bradford was thirteen years younger
than Robinson, and but a mere boy
when the church at Scrooby was
formed, and only nineteen at the removal
to Leyden. He was a noble
youth (and a nobler man) and was
easily influenced and led by Brewster
and Robinson. The whole company
went to Leyden expecting probably to
spend their lives there, and engaged
in various business callings and occupations.
On coming of age, Bradford
inherited some money. This he sank
in unfortunate business operations.
Brewster had been postmaster at
Scrooby from 1594 to 1607, when he
resigned, presumably because his
sympathy with the “Separatists” was
obnoxious to the government, which,
in all probability, would have removed
him had not he himself deprived it
of that pleasure, by vacating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
office, following which action he immediately
went to Holland.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that the
Pilgrims, as a congregation or church,
were not the first Separatist body or
organization, for one John Smith had
organized a company of these people
as early as 1602, at Gainsborough,
numbering some three or four hundred,
and in 1604 went with them to Amsterdam.
This was undoubtedly one
reason for the Pilgrims going to that
place under Brewster and Bradford,
instead of going to any other place.
It is believed that Robinson had little
or no connection with our Pilgrims
until after Brewster left the post-office,
and they were about to leave Scrooby.
On the way to Amsterdam, and later,
on the way to and at Leyden, accessions
were made to the company, so
that before the final emigration their
numbers had reached between two
and three hundred. These latter additions
were from the common or
laboring class, who, in all probability,
joined in the wake of the movement,
thinking to better their worldly condition.</p>

<p>On this point another English writer
has said: “The vicinity of Scrooby
was an agricultural district, having a
few villages scattered about, each with
its church and perhaps an esquire’s
seat, but the population was for the
most part employed in husbandry, an
occupation little congenial to the
growth of extreme opinions in either
religion or politics or of voluntary
sacrifices to a severe estimate of duty,
or a supposed call of conscience.” The
same writer, speaking of those who
were even prominently identified with
the movement, says: “Neither Bradford
nor Brewster, nor the divines who
were concerned in the movement, were
of the eminent of the earth, about
whom there is curiosity widely extended
through the country which gave
them birth, and concerning whom
nothing is thought unimportant. It
may even be said that they were but
inconsiderable persons at home, and
their consequence has undoubtedly
arisen out of the grand results which,
unforeseen by themselves, have ensued
on their great resolve. So that
there is scarcely anything to be told of
their early history besides those very
small facts which make the history of
men who are of but small account in
the midst of a large and advanced
population.” It has also been said
that the Pilgrims, as we speak of
them, would scarcely have been heard
of had it not been first for Robinson and
Brewster and Bradford, and there can
be no doubt that the great majority of
them came to this country that they
might find homes and advance their
worldly circumstances.</p>

<p>An American of high historical
standing and learning has said:
“Here lay a new world for the most
part unoccupied, inviting colonization,
and it was as natural for men to come
and settle here as to embark in any
other enterprise in life. The only wonder
is that the work of colonization
was not begun earlier and pursued by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
thousands rather than by hundreds.”
This colonizing, this settling and developing
a country, the desire to own
the roof under which one sleeps “raise
the personal importance and dignity
of the subject or citizens,” and “it can
never be too well understood that the
generations of men sow and plant for
their successors.” It seems to have
been an entire and pushing necessity
that these people should get away
from Holland in order to secure a comfortable
living and to make any provision
for their posterity. Bradford
says: “The country (Holland) was
hard and many were discouraged.
Grim and grizzled poverty was coming
on them as an armed man, old age
was coming upon them and no amelioration
of their condition came with
it.” That they should come to America,
and for the reasons given, seems
quite reasonable and natural when it is
remembered that Captain Smith and
others, returning to England, had expressed
the opinion that the fisheries
on the New England coast might be
made profitable. And we know that
this was one of the first industries engaged
in by the Pilgrims. Smith states
that in 1616 four ships of London and
two of Plymouth and Sir Richard
Hawkins were again in the fishing
waters in the vicinity of Massachusetts
and Maine.</p>

<p>Early in 1620, also, six or seven
sailing vessels set out for the western
country for the same purpose and visited
the country about the harbor
where the Pilgrims landed in December
following.</p>

<p>That there was a Providence in their
coming here is altogether probable.
That the same Providence reached out
and extended its ruling and benignant
hand on the journey and after the arrival
is certain.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt, a great over-ruling
power in all human affairs, but
our concern (the emigration) is with
second causes, and it is to be believed
that we often deceive ourselves when
we attempt to recover general principles
from which things remarkable in
the acts of men have sprung.” “And
if we conclude that these people had
mistaken the path or duty, or had imposed
upon themselves a severer
burthen than God ever intended for
them, there it still a heroism in their
conduct which forbids us to regard
them with indifference, nay rather,
which will call forth the sympathy of
every generous mind.”</p>

<p>There has been neither design nor
desire, in what has been said, to reflect
on the character of the Pilgrims,
or to detract from the high fame and
renown to which they are justly entitled.
No one has more appreciation
of their virtues or greater veneration
for their memories than the writer. A
train of thought only has been followed
which led in a channel that seems to
be altogether reasonable and intelligent.
When a genealogist thought
to please Napoleon by telling him that
his descent could be traced from some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
ancient line of Gothic princes, he replied
that he dated his patent of
nobility from the battle of Monte Notte
(his first victory.) The Pilgrims inherited
their patent of nobility and derived
their claim to immortality by the excellence
of their example and the
beauty and usefulness of their lives.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WERE_THE_DUTCH_ON_MANHATTAN_ISLAND_IN_1598">WERE THE DUTCH ON MANHATTAN ISLAND IN 1598?</h2>

</div>

<p>It will admit of but very little dispute
that Verrazano in 1524, and
Gomez in 1525, anticipated Henry
Hudson by several decades in the discovery
of New York Bay and the
Hudson River. There is also a claim
for previous discovery however, put
forward in behalf of the Dutch. One
confident historian of the Metropolis
starts out bravely and unhesitatingly
with the assertion that the Dutch were
here as early as 1598; but he gives no
authorities from whence he had gathered
this startling piece of information,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
yet before one has read thirty
pages of such a well-known work as
Dr. E. B. O’Callaghan’s, “History of
New Netherland,” the source of the
statement is plainly indicated, and
fortunately, also the opportunity for a
careful weighing of the testimony supporting
it.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp95" id="illus12" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus12.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>MANHATTAN ISLAND IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Dr. O’Callaghan refers his readers to
a Dutch document in the State Archives
at Albany, discovered by Mr.
Brodhead at the Hague, copied by
him for his collection of documents
and translated and published in that
invaluable store-house of historical
material, the “Documents relating to
the Colonial History of the State of
New York,” vol. I, pp. 149, <i>et seq.</i>
Here we read: “New Netherland ...
was first frequented [explored] by the
inhabitants of this country [Holland]
in the year 1598, and especially by
those of the Greenland Company, but
without making any fixed settlements,
only as a shelter [resort] in the winter.
For which purpose they erected
on the North [Hudson] and South
[Delaware] Rivers there, two little forts
against the incursions of the Indians.
A charter was afterwards, on the 11th
of October, 1614, granted by their
High Mightinesses to trade exclusively
to the newly discovered countries.”</p>

<p>Without discussing the nature or
merits of this document itself just now,
we will first weigh the value of its
statement. The Hollanders who
“frequented” Manhattan Island in
1598, were in the employ of a Dutch
“Greenland Company.” Now it
would seem to be of some importance
for the establishment of the interesting
fact under discussion, that there be
brought forward some evidence of the
existence of such an association as this
Greenland Company. For certainly
if no trace of its existence can be found,
this would cast serious doubt upon
the exploits of its servants in these
waters.</p>

<p>We have to begin with announcing
the lamentable fact that after a thorough
search of every imaginable
source of information, we have been
unable to discover the existence of a
Dutch Greenland Company prior to the
year 1600. The works of Dutch historians,
both ancient and modern,
were carefully scanned, but all in vain.
We began with a modern writer, N. G.
Van Kampen, sometimes called by his
fond and admiring countrymen, the
Dutch Macaulay. He wrote an elaborate
and extensive work of four or
five octavo volumes on “De Nederlanders
buiten Europa” (The Netherlanders
outside of Europe), giving an
eloquent as well as exhaustive review
of those splendid achievements in
various portions of the globe, which
resulted in the establishment of the
great Colonial Empire of the Dutch,
even at this day second only to that
of the English.</p>

<p>But there is found no mention of a
Dutch Greenland Company or its doings
either in these volumes or in
Wagenaar, who lived in the eighteenth
century and issued more than one
monumental publication, or in Bor or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Van Meteren of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. These older
writers let no event or transaction or
institution of any importance escape
them. They were not afraid of multiplying
their volumes and therefore
not at all deterred from noting even
the minutest affairs that came within
their ken, as they laboriously proceeded
from year to year. But they
are all strangely silent about this
apocryphal company whose mariners
were in the habit of sheltering themselves
on Manhattan Island before
1600.</p>

<p>But now it is only fair to indicate
how the tradition may have originated
that there ever was such an
organization as the Greenland Company.
An appreciation of any reasonable
grounds for its origin, will help us
understand better how the mistaken
statement came to be made, and to
see that it was a mistake. There did
exist in Holland a “Noordsche Compagnie”
or Northern Company and
there exists the most abundant and
indubitable evidence that the terms
“Northern Company” and “Greenland
Company” were used interchangeably,
and were both applied to
the former association. This company
was at first confined to the merchants
of the Province of Holland, who had
received their charter from the States-General,
after the approval and endorsement
of such a measure by the
States of Holland. In 1617, the charter
was renewed, but the merchants of
Zeeland wished for the same privileges
and the States-General granted a
charter to a Zeeland “Northern Company”
in May 28, 1622. Turning to
the “Groot Placcaet Book,” Vol. I,
Cols. 673, 674, we discover the two
names in question in curious but instructive
juxtaposition. The title of
the act has Noortsche Compagnie,
while in the body of the act we read
Groenlandtsche Compagnie. In this
same year (Dec., 1622), the Zeeland and
Holland Companies were combined
into one general or national “Northern
Company,” but the act granting a
larger charter mentions only the above
name both in the title and in the body
of it. It is to this Company that Moulton
refers in his “History of New
York” (p. 362) when he makes the
assertion that “the Greenland Company
was created in 1622.” He places
this association on an exact level with
the East and West India Companies.</p>

<p>“Thus the Northern Seas, Asia,
Africa and America, were partitioned
to three armed associations, possessing
powers nearly co-extensive with
those of the Republic.” The company
chartered in 1622, (as we have
seen), can not properly be classed as
equal in importance or influence or
power with the two great commercial
associations named in one breath with
it by Mr. Moulton. And we have
seen also, that it did not officially bear
the name he gives it, although that
name might be interchangeable with
the true one in the case of subordinate
companies. Yet even this is not the
case with the charter creating the original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
company confined to Holland
Province alone, where there is no
mention of the name “Greenland” in
either the title or the body of the document.
Lastly there is this significant
circumstance about that
earliest charter of any “Northern
Company;” it bears date January
1614, and distinctly states “that no
such company had ever been chartered
before.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This therefore settles
the question as to whether it could
possibly have been men in the employ
of this company, miscalled the
“Greenland Company,” who habitually
sought relief from the rigors of
an Arctic winter on the shores of the
Hudson River in the year 1598. This
could hardly have been when it was
not erected or chartered until January
1614.</p>

<p>In the second place, if frequent or
habitual visits to Manhattan Island
were made by the Dutch in and after
the year 1598, we are at a loss to comprehend
the entire lack of recollection
of such visits on the part of the Indians
thereabouts. It is insisted on
more than once in various accounts
that both the vessel and the persons
of its crew, were objects of boundless
wonder to the natives, as they
beheld the “Half-Moon” resting
upon the waters of the bay or
gliding up the river. De Laet, one of
the earliest to write on Hudson’s discovery,
publishing his “Nieuwe
Wereld,” (New World) in 1625 and
basing his statements on those of
Hudson’s own journal, perhaps citing
his very words, speaks as follows:
“So far as they could judge and find
out, there had never been any ships
or Christians in this region before, so
that they were the first who discovered
this river and sailed up so far.” Such
a declaration might need to be received
with some suspicion, if the
author had intended to maintain a
claim of the first discovery for the
Dutch as against other nations. But
he could have had no reason to suppress
the circumstance of the visits of
the Dutch themselves to our river, in
1598. If that had been patent to De
Laet he would have been only too
glad to mention it, as only increasing
the validity of the Dutch claims to
those regions by the right of first discovery.
He could have had no particular
object in glorifying the Englishman
Hudson’s exploit at the
expense of the sailors of an exclusively
and undoubtedly Dutch Greenland
Company. But returning to the Indians,
we notice in Vander Donck’s
celebrated “Vertoogh,” written at
New Amsterdam and published at the
Hague in 1650, another arraignment
of their poor memories. “Even at the
present day those natives of the country
who are so old as to recollect
when the Dutch ships first came here,
declare that when they saw them, they
did not know what to make of them.
Some among them when the first one
arrived, even imagined it to be a fish
or some monster of the sea.” Now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
the Indians might indeed have
forgotten a visit made so long ago as
1524 or 1525, if Verrazano and Gomez
really did discover the Hudson then,
making but a brief stay and a rapid
examination of its banks at best, but
an habitual resort to its shores, or even
one winter spent on the island at its
mouth, in forts built to repel their
attacks, only eleven years before Hudson
came among them, the Indians
could not possibly, it would seem,
have so utterly forgotten in 1609.</p>

<p>But we will now give our attention
more particularly to the document
which asserts that the Dutch were on
Manhattan Island as early as 1598.
What was the nature of it, and to
what degree of credence is it entitled?
Mr. Brodhead in the explanatory heading
which he usually prefixes to the
documents in his collection states that
it is a report made in 1644 by the
Chairman of a Committee or Board of
Accounts, appointed by the directors
of the West India Company. Several
documents were placed in his (the
chairman’s) hands for the purpose of
enabling him to furnish to the company
a succinct review of events connected
with the origin of the settlement
on Manhattan Island, and with its
progress up to that date. The writer begins
with the story of the Dutch and their
forts in 1598. Immediately after this the
official historian glides easily into
what he evidently either considers
himself, or wishes others to believe,
is the next stage in the history of the
Manhattan Colony; namely this: “a
charter was afterwards on the 11th of
October 1614, granted by their High
Mightinesses.” As if nothing of importance
had happened between 1598
and 1614!</p>

<p>The question therefore arises, if this
was meant for history in 1644, why
was it written so imperfectly? It could
not be that the fact of Hudson’s discovery,
so vitally connected with the
origin of Manhattan Colony, had been
completely forgotten at that time,
much less that after a careful examination
of all the papers available to directors
of the West India Company, the
chairman of their committee should not
have come across the record of that
discovery. How then did he happen
to pass it over in utter silence in his
official report? Was it purposely suppressed?
If so, what could have been
the motive for this singular proceeding?</p>

<p>We think we can readily divine
what the motive was, when we read
in more than one English writer what
use that nation contrived to make of
the fact that the discovery of the Hudson
River was achieved by an Englishman.
Peter Heylin, who wrote before
the surrender of New Netherland in
1664, remarks: “With him [i. e. Hudson]
the Hollanders, in 1609, compounded
for his charts and maps; but
they were hardly warm in their new
Habitations,” when Argall, Governor
of Virginia, disputed their title to this
region, which was looked upon as part
of Virginia territory. The latter advanced
this ingenious argument in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
support of his claim; “that Hudson,
under whose sale they claimed that
country, being an Englishman and
licensed to discover those northern
parts by the King of England, could
not alienate or dismember it (being but
a part or province of Virginia) from the
Crown thereof.” This matter of a
“sale” by Hudson, which was illegal,
and the subsequent “right” of the
English to New Netherland, is brought
out again in a book written nearly a
century later, or long after the problem
which was unsolved in Heylin’s time—how
to get the Dutch out and the
English in—had been solved by
Colonel Nicolls in 1664. In this book,
William Smith’s “History of New
York” (1757), we read, scarcely without
a smile: “Henry Hudson, an Englishman,
<i>according to our authors</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in
the year 1608 [sic], under a commission
from the King, his master, discovered
Long Island, New York, and the
river which still bears his name; and
afterwards sold the country, or rather
his Right to the Dutch. Their writers
contend that Hudson was sent out by
the East India Company in 1609 to
discover a northwest passage to China.
It is said however, that there was a
sale; and that the English objected to
it, though they for some time neglected
to oppose the Dutch settlement of the
country.”</p>

<p>Now we can readily appreciate why
the Dutch West India Company might
have a distinct and deliberate object in
not being too exact in their history of
Manhattan Colony. They would naturally
be very shy of giving occasion
or encouragement to a rival nation on
the alert to press a claim avowedly
made, however unjust, to territories
entrusted to the Company’s care and
government. It would to say the
least have been very impolitic to give
countenance to it in one of their own
official papers. About twelve years
later the directors, writing to Stuyvesant,
while commending him for the
reduction of New Sweden, at the same
time remonstrated with him for having
made a written agreement with the
Swedish Commander. And they then
put into so many words the shrewd
policy which we suggest they followed
in the present instance, saying;
“What is written is too long preserved
and may be produced when not desired,
whereas words not recorded are
in the lapse of time forgotten, or may
be explained away” (O’Callaghan’s
“New Netherland,” vol. II. p. 327).
If Argall on the spot, and only a few
years after the settlement; if Heylin
in a book written and published before
1664, could make so much of Hudson’s
nationality in the matter of his
discovery, so that more than a hundred
years after that event, sober historians
could still cooly repeat the
story of England’s supreme right, and
quite cast aside the claims of the
Dutch, then it may well have been
considered in 1644 that it would be a
dangerous concession to have even
made an allusion to Hudson in a committee
report. Under these circumstances,
finding at home a possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
prevalent and convenient rumor about
the Greenland Company and its vessels
in New York bay and river, without
any intention to deliberately falsify,
the chairman of the committee simply
incorporated the statement under discussion
in his report. For business
purposes, on a paper prepared by business
men and not by historians, this
may have been good enough history;
but being preserved in this documentary
form, and read in an age eager for
documentary evidence and too ready
to give undue weight to unpublished
and original matter, the assertion derived
an importance which it does not
really deserve, and was not intended
to possess. And so entirely unsupported
is it by other proofs, or by the
facts of history, that even the documentary
character of this evidence has
not prevailed to deceive wise and
judicious investigators. It is clear
that it did not commend itself as
quite trustworthy for historical purposes
to Dr. O’Callaghan. In quoting
it, though it own assertion is entirely
positive, he introduces its language
by the cautious phrase, “it is
said.” Brodhead, whose researches
brought the paper to light, also deals
very gingerly with it, holding it off at
arms length, so to speak, and saying:
“it needs confirmation”—and indeed,
it certainly does.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_FAMOUS_POLITICAL_CONTEST_IN_ILLINOIS">A FAMOUS POLITICAL CONTEST IN ILLINOIS.<br>
<span class="smaller">HON. HENRY H. EVANS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The most interesting political contest
which has taken place in the State of
Illinois since the days of Lincoln and
Douglass, was that which ended with
the election of General John M.
Palmer to the United States Senate,
on the 11th day of March, 1891. The
contest was of historic interest because
it elevated to the Senate, a man
who had long been a conspicuous figure
in American politics, and who had
for many years cherished an ambition
to occupy a seat in the Upper Bench
of the national Legislature. It was of
interest also because it gave to the
Democratic party of Illinois, for the
first time in many years, a representative
in the United States Senate. It
was moreover an intensely interesting
and exciting contest—and greater interest
attached to it on this than on
any other account—because it developed
a crisis in the political affairs of
the State.</p>

<p>It is no harsh criticism of the Republican
management of the State
campaign of 1890, in Illinois, to say
that the campaign was lazily conducted.
At the Democratic Convention,
held some months before the
election, General John M. Palmer had
been formally endorsed as the choice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
of his party for United States Senator,
and his adherents at once entered
upon a determined and aggressive
campaign. The result of this spirited
Democratic campaigning, of Republican
apathy, and of disturbing “side
issues,” was, that when the roll of the
Thirty-seventh General Assembly was
made up, it was ascertained that there
were 101 Democratic members elect,
100 Republicans, and three representatives
of the Farmers’ Alliance organization.</p>

<p>This being the political status of the
body which was to choose a United
States Senator, it was evident that the
three independent or Farmers’ Alliance
members held the balance of power
as between the two great political
parties. These three legislators thought
they saw before them great opportunities
for the advancement of their
interests, and starting a political revolution.
Once before it had happened
in the history of the State, that a little
band of five legislators—the representatives
of the “Anti-Nebraska” party—had
placed in the field a candidate
for United States Senator, of their
own choosing, and in full sympathy
with their political views, and at the
end of a long contest that candidate
had been triumphantly elected, and a
new political party had been brought
into existence.</p>

<p>The triumvirate of the Thirty-seventh
General Assembly of Illinois,
hastily jumped to the conclusion
that there was to be a repetition of
history, and that what the “Anti-Nebraska”
legislators had accomplished
in 1885, could be accomplished by the
representatives of the Farmers’ Alliance
in 1891.</p>

<p>When the Legislature convened they
accordingly placed in nomination as
their candidate for United States Senator,
Alanson J. Streeter, a farmer by occupation,
whose large wealth had enabled
him to take up politics as a diversion,
and whose views had been of
a sufficiently variegated character, to
enable him to claim political kinship
with any of the existing partisan organizations.</p>

<p>General Palmer was already in the
field as the Democratic candidate for
Senator, and the Republicans named
ex-Governor Richard J. Oglesby as
their nominee. Balloting began on
the 20th day of January and continued
from day to day—when the Legislature
was in session—until the 11th of
March, when the contest ended as
already stated.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Farmers’ Alliance
members, from start to finish, toward
the Republican minority, was in effect,
that they presented to them the alternative
of electing the Alliance nominee
with Republican votes, or of allowing
the Democratic nominee to be
elected by Alliance votes. The proposition
was one as humiliating to the
great political organization to which
it was made, as it was inconsistent
in those who made it. Nevertheless,
it was adhered to and
all counter-propositions were rejected.
Republican diplomacy was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
tried without result, the Alliance members
refusing to vote for a leading
representative of their own interests
when he was put forward as the Republican
nominee.</p>

<p>As the contest was prolonged, the
feeling between Republicans and
Democrats became more intensely antagonistic,
and a point was finally
reached where some of the Republican
leaders apparently determined to defeat
General Palmer at any cost. To
do this they determined to throw the
support of the entire Republican membership
of the Legislature to Streeter,
thereby securing his election by a
majority of two votes. Principles were
for the time being lost sight of by those
who favored this movement. Political
trusts were relegated to the region of
barren idealities, and rank heresies
were to be swallowed without a grimace
for the sole purpose of compassing
the defeat of an old time political
adversary.</p>

<p>That the dominant party of the third
State in the Union was not in a sense,
committed to the vagaries of a nondescript
political organization, and made
directly responsible for the acts of one
of its most erratic representatives, was
due to the sound judgment and positive
convictions of a very small number of
Republican Legislators, of whom
Hon. Henry H. Evans, representing
the Fourteenth Senatorial District, was
the acknowledged leader.</p>

<p>While Colonel Evans had long been
prominent in the politics of the State
and had had much to do with shaping
its legislatures for a dozen years or
more, no other event in his life has
brought him so conspicuously before
the public as the determined stand
which he took against, what could not
have been regarded in the future, as
anything else than a sacrifice of the
political integrity of his party. While
those who were engineering this
movement may have been mistaken in
their calculations, they frequently
affirmed that they could deliver to the
Alliance candidate for Senator, the
entire Republican vote of the Legislature,
provided Senator Evans would
consent to have this vote so recorded,
and it is reasonably certain that his
colleagues of the opposition were
largely influenced by him. The pressure
brought to bear on him, to induce
him to become a party to the combine
with the Alliance, was of the most
powerful kind, but to entreaties, arguments
and threats alike, he returned
the same answer, the gist of which
is contained in a brief statement of his
intentions, to which he gave utterance
at one of the numerous Republican
caucuses, at which this matter was
considered. On that occasion he said:
“I want to say to this caucus, that I
will never vote for any of these men
for United States Senator, no matter
what this caucus may think. I am a
Republican, and I am for a Republican.
I was elected and sent here to
vote for a Republican for United States
Senator, and that I will do to the end
of this contest. But I do not think we
should humiliate the glorious old Republican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
party of Illinois, by bartering
away our independence for the sake
of sending to the Senate a political
nondescript for whose official action
we must be responsible.”</p>

<p>This was the ringing declaration of
an honest and courageous representative
of well defined political principles.
It was a declaration of his purposes
from which he did not deviate
during the contest, and no public
servant ever made a better record
for consistency and a strict observance
of his obligations to his constituency.</p>

<p>The prominence which he attained
in this honorable contest, and through
public services previously rendered,
have made him one of the prominent
figures among the public men of Illinois,
and the story of his life becomes
interesting.</p>

<p>Born at Toronto, Canada, March 9,
1836, he has been essentially the architect
of his own fortune. His father,
Griffith Evans, and his wife, (Elizabeth
Weldon), were both natives of Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, being descendants
of families ante-dating the Revolution—so
that, although born on Canadian
soil, Colonel Evans is of thoroughly
American ancestry.</p>

<p>His father was a millwright by
trade, who with his wife and family
settled at Aurora, Illinois, in 1841.
Colonel Evans was next to the eldest
of ten children. The father was an
industrious and intelligent mechanic
who had more or less to do with the
erection and equipment of several
large mills in the neighborhood of
Aurora, but he never accumulated any
considerable amount of property, and
his children had to depend mainly
upon their own resources.</p>

<p>Col. Evans received his education
in the public schools of Aurora, grew
to manhood there, and then married
Alice M. Rhodes, a lady of English
birth and parentage. Soon after his
marriage, he engaged in the restaurant
business and continued in this
business until September, 1862, when
he enlisted in the One Hundred and
Twenty-fourth Regiment of Illinois
Volunteer Infantry. He was mustered
into the service at Springfield, Illinois,
went into action first at Jackson,
Tenn., participated in the siege of
Vicksburg and in successive campaigns,
being mustered out of service
at the end of three years days from the
date of his enlistment.</p>

<p>Immediately after his retirement
from the military service, he returned
to his old business in Aurora. Enterprising,
shrewd and capable, his
business expanded and he became
the proprietor and then owner
of the leading hotel of the city,
and one of its most enterprising
and public spirited citizens.
He became largely interested in real
estate, laying out several large additions
to the city, and realizing handsome
profits from his investments.
In 1882, he organized the Aurora Street
Railroad Company, took charge of
the construction of the road, and
pushed to completion, an enterprise
which has since been developed into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
one of the most perfect electric railroad
systems in the West. He was
also the projector of the Joliet and
Aurora Northern Railroad, an enterprise
with which he was most actively
identified up to the date of its going
into operation, and at a late date as
one of its leading officials. In everything
calculated to contribute in any
way to the growth and prosperity of
Aurora he has taken a most active
interest, and as a natural consequence
of this, coupled with a cheering geniality,
he has always enjoyed great
popularity.</p>

<p>His political life began in 1876,
when he was elected an Alderman for
one of the wards of Aurora. In the
fall of the same year he was elected a
member of the State Legislature.
After serving one term in the House
of Representatives, he was elected, in
1880, a member of the State Senate,
and has been twice re-elected since
that time. As a member of the General
Assembly, he has become recognized
as a careful and conscientious
legislator, with a large stock of practical
ideas, and a capacity for energetic
and persistent efforts, which have
made his services peculiarly valuable
to his constituents. While serving
his first term in the Legislature he
introduced and succeeded in having
enacted into a law, the bill providing
for the establishment of a State Soldier’s
Home in Illinois—an institution
which does great credit to the State.</p>

<p>He was also the author of the law
under which the National Guard is
now organized, a measure which met
with determined opposition at the
time of its introduction. Despite the
opposition however, it became a law,
and the wisdom of the act has since
been demonstrated on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>In recognition of his services in
perfecting the organization of and
rendering effective the State Militia,
Governor Shelby M. Cullom made
him a member of his military staff,
with the rank of colonel. He was
appointed to the same position on the
staff of Governor Hamilton and Governor
Oglesby, and is now serving on
the staff of Governor Fifer.</p>

<p>The Police Pension bill was another
of the important measures which
had his successful advocacy.</p>

<p>The life of Col. Evans strikingly emphasizes
the marvelous industry, tireless
energy, and broad spirit of enterprise
that are to-day so characteristic
of the American man of affairs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EDITORIAL_AND_HISTORICAL_NOTES">EDITORIAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES.</h2>

</div>

<p>The present (November) number of the
Magazine of Western History, which is the
first number of the new volume (Vol. XV)
appears under a new name which will more
adequately describe its present character.</p>

<p>The title chosen—“THE NATIONAL
MAGAZINE—<span class="smcap">A Journal Devoted to
American History</span>—” is in keeping with
the enlarged scope and purpose of the publication.
When it first came into existence,
its proposed mission was to gather and preserve
the history of that great West which
lies beyond the Alleghanies, and while that
labor has been pursued with results that have
enriched American history, the boundaries
have been gradually enlarged until the whole
country has become its field of research, and
readers and contributors are found in every
State and territory.</p>

<p>The Magazine has become <span class="smcap">National</span>, and it
is believed that the present name will be
accepted as more appropriate than the one
that has been outgrown.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The new name defines, perhaps with sufficient
fullness, both scope and purpose, but
for the sake of clearness we add that it is
proposed to confine our interest exclusively
to the field of American History, and whatever
directly illustrates it. By this we
mean not alone or chiefly the history of our
remote past with its discoveries, its early
settlers, and its struggling colonies, but the
history as well of the present century—the
planting of colonies by railroads, the evolution
of States, the founding of cities, the
building up of a literature, the history of
politics, and of all that unexampled material
progress that makes America the wonder
and admiration of the world.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The great civil war has served necessarily
as an extraordinary stimulus to historical
writing and research concerning its
antecedent causes, the tremendous conflict
itself, and its far reaching and still potent
consequences. It is plain however, that the
history of the war has yet been written only
in outline. The historical material which
when gathered and sifted would give it completeness
and fullness is as yet largely unwritten.
This exists in the recollections of
men yet living—actors and witnesses—in
their letters, journals and other written
memoranda, and in the traditions carefully
cherished by families and friends of those
that are gone. We propose to collect such
material as far as possible, and give it a
permanent record in our pages.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the interesting features of our
national life is the growth of societies for
the encouragement of historical studies as
well as the preservation of valuable historical
material which would otherwise be lost.
The historical societies having permanent
homes, number nearly or quite two hundred
and fifty, and while some of the largest support
intermittent publications of their own,
we believe there is no general organ devoted
to their interests and furnishing a medium
of intercourse between them. The National
Magazine proposes, as far as possible, to
supply this want and will conduct a separate
department giving all notes of interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
regarding the Historical Societies of the
United States which we may be able to
obtain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is believed that a large amount of historical
material of great interest both to the
general reader and the historical student
exists in the shape of papers prepared by
members of these various Historical Societies
for the interest and instruction of their
particular organizations.</p>

<p>Such papers as we refer to are prepared
for the most part by members who have
both leisure and taste for historical research,
or who find in such work a grateful relief
from the exacting cares of successful professional
and business careers, and although
addressed to a limited circle, have frequently
a value and interest that entitles them to
a larger audience and to preservation in
more permanent form.</p>

<p>It is proposed to present in the pages of
the Magazine, in pursuance of our general
purpose to broaden the field of its interest
and usefulness, a selection from such
papers. It is believed that the literature of
American History would be greatly enriched
from this source. Papers of even local interest
are not without value to the student
of history in any portion of the country,
and all these various efforts at writing history
are building up that great body of
historical material from which American
History at least in the nineteenth century is
to be exhaustively and philosophically
written.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“In lighter vein” we propose to touch on
the picturesque side of historical research,
and to seek material in the legends and traditions
that attach to certain localities. The
very fact that a certain headland, valley,
mountain or river has a legendary interest is
not undeserving the attention of the scholar
and is a matter of legitimate historical interest
if not value. A country as new as ours
can well afford to jealously preserve whatever
of such legendary and historical lore it
may have. It at least serves to “adorn the
tale” which has a more solid basis. Other
changes are contemplated that will add
value, and interest to the pages of the Magazine.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The present number contains the first installment
of a series of articles from the
advance sheets of the forthcoming Memorial
History of New York, edited by Gen.
James Grant Wilson. It is the intention to
select for publication in the Magazine such
parts of this work as will in our judgment
be of great interest to its readers, and
as far as possible present a continuous narrative.
These articles will be amply illustrated
from the plates prepared and selected
for the original work with great care. The
exhaustive character of the work, the time
given to its preparation, the staff of contributors
each pre-eminent in his special field,
are fully set forth on the cover of the present
number.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the August number of this Magazine
we remarked upon the fact that the historic
property of Valley Forge was in danger of
being sold and divided among individual
purchasers and that in this event the ancient
ramparts of Fort Washington, the site of
the forge, the cold spring, and the Headquarters
of Washington, Lafayette and
Knox would be obliterated. It is a pleasure
to learn that the march of such “improvement”
will probably be arrested. A meeting
of the members of the National Society of
the Daughters of the Revolution residing in
Washington was held on Oct. 13th, and a
plan was considered for purchasing and preserving
this property. The Illinois chapter
of the same organization has also held a
meeting to advance the same cause. With
the patriotic ardor of women thoroughly
awakened there should be no question about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
preserving to the nation the field of Valley
Forge with all its “visible history.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A monument to the great Indian Chief
Red Jacket, Chief of the Senecas and the
renowned orator of the six nations was
dedicated at Waterloo, N. Y. on Oct. 14th.
President Welles of the Waterloo Historical
Society under whose auspices the monument
is erected presided. The Hon. W. C.
Bryant of Buffalo delivered an historical
address. The monument is unique in design,
being carved from a block of granite
to represent the trunk of an oak tree, and
stands on the west shore of Cayuga Lake
near the spot where Red Jacket was born.
The base bears four descriptive bronze
tablets, and around the base are clustered
six small bowlders bearing the names of the
six nations of the Iroquois. Red Jacket
was one of the unique figures of his time,
his character a peculiar mixture of the
noble and the ignoble, a sagacious statesman,
a cunning demagogue, but always an
Indian.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A gathering both important and unique
was held in Independence Hall, Philadelphia,
on the 12th of October. The occasion
was the reunion of a committee which has
undertaken to organize a Pan-Republic Congress
and Human Freedom League, and to
arrange an international meeting in connection
with the anniversary ceremonies of 1892.
The leaders of the movement claim that
their ideas have been gradually disseminated
through organized societies in all civilized
countries. Their meaning and purpose they
broadly state to be: That the four hundredth
anniversary of the discovery of this
continent should be celebrated by a convocation,
first of the representatives of all governments
based on an acknowledgment of the
rights of man, and secondly, of representatives
of the people of high purpose everywhere,
independent of the form of government
under which they live. That these two
bodies acting in concert on the soil of the
greatest of the governments founded upon
freedom, should consult together on the
means of widening the domain in which the
earth’s dwellers may enjoy the rights
claimed for us by our immortal Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Youngest among the sisterhood of the
States of our Union stands Washington, on
the borders of the far Pacific. It is very
gratifying to observe the citizens of a community
of such regent origin, amid the
eager competitions of life and the pressure of
material interests, turning aside from these
practical pursuits to secure for future generations
a record not only of their own achievements,
but of the humbler and more
heroic doings of the pioneers of their State.
Such is the aim and purpose of the Washington
State Historical Society, organized during
the present month in the city of Tacoma,
and the latest to join the ever widening circle
of these societies. In the words of its president,
the Hon. Elwood Evans, “the State
of Washington has reached a time when the
need of collecting original historical material
has become imperative since the history
of the State and Territory runs back 38
years, and most of the early settlers are dead.
The hardships and heroism of the pioneers
should be handed down and recorded as material
for the historian of later years.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RECENT_HISTORICAL_PUBLICATIONS">RECENT HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS.</h2>

</div>

<h3 class="book">“<span class="smcap">Historical Essays.</span>” By Henry Adams.
Chas. Scribners’ Sons.</h3>

<p>In this volume are gathered a number of
essays, chiefly on historical subjects, which
have appeared at various times in magazines.
They are characterized, as might be expected,
by the clear and attractive style and the incisive
thought that belongs to all of Mr.
Adams’ literary work.</p>

<p>Some of the essays are of pronounced value
and interest. Notably the essay on the Gold
Conspiracy, which to any one who is at all
familiar with the details of one of the most
remarkable episodes in American financial
history, will prove absorbingly interesting. It
contains a sketch of Jay Gould, which, in the
light of recent occurrences, has a peculiar interest.</p>

<p>In no field of investigation at the present
time is the skeptical spirit more active than
in the historical, and the essay on Capt. John
Smith will provoke some criticism and more
regret, as it is an effort to cut away the historic
basis from the beautiful story of Pocahontas.
As Dr. Schliemann has lifted Troy
and its legends to the dignity of history, perhaps
some historical explorer may be inspired
to undertake the same task for the Pocahontas
incident.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We have received in pamphlet form, as one
of the published collections of the Minnesota
Historical Society for 1891, the account of the
ceremonies of the two hundredth anniversary
of the discovery of the Falls of St. Anthony
by Father Hennepin in 1680, and the different
papers read on that interesting occasion. This
“Part” is a continuation of the series of short
sketches and papers which had been interrupted,
and makes a valuable addition to the data
for Western History. It is a real pleasure to
praise the beautiful typographical appearance
of this pamphlet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="book">“<span class="smcap">Beginnings of Literary Culture in the
Ohio Valley.</span>” By W. H. Venable, L.L.D.
Robert Clarke &amp; Co., 1891.</h3>

<p>Dr. Venable has been very successful in his
undertaking to show the progress of literature,
education, art, politics and religion in the Ohio
Valley, from the days of the early settlers
until the present time. He has done this by
sketching the careers of those who have been
conspicuous in these fields of culture and
practical interest, and has gathered a great
fund of information, anecdote and biographical
detail, which has made his narrative very
interesting as well as full.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="book">“<span class="smcap">James Freeman Clarke. Autobiography,
Diary and Correspondence.</span>” Edited by
Edward Everett Hale. Houghton, Mifflin &amp;
Co., 1891.</h3>

<p>A book on James Freeman Clarke, by
Edward Everett Hale, encourages “great expectations,”
and these expectations are not
disappointed.</p>

<p>It is a delightful mixture of the handiwork
of two bright thinkers and recognized lights
in our native literature. After a modest account
of himself, the subject of the sketch is
delineated still further by a fond and appreciative
friend. The man, broad and free and
catholic in his thinking and in his feeling,
opens his heart to us in diary and letters.
And what he fails to tell, as eminently improper
for himself to tell, Dr. Hale gives to
us, so that the picture may be complete. The
keynote to the book, and the real use of it, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
indicated on the first page by Dr. Clarke himself:
“I have lived in an important period;
have known many eminent men and distinguished
women; have seen great changes in
social life, in religious opinion, in private
morals and public manners. If I can succeed
in making a few suggestive pictures, or
memory sketches, it may be a gratification to
my children and friends, and possibly contribute
matter for the future historian of this
period.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="book">“<span class="smcap">Historical Collection of Ohio.</span>” By Henry
Howe, L.L.D.</h3>

<p>The two concluding volumes of the Historical
Collections of Ohio are now published together,
and complete a monumental work.
Dr. Howe has given many years to this undertaking,
and is said to have personally visited
every locality of which he treats, and collected
his facts from the lips of living men and
women as well as from written records. The
work is more than a formal history. It unfolds
before the reader the whole life and
annals of Ohio, from the earliest settlements
to the present day. Geography and statistics
go hand in hand with narration, reminiscence
and details of social life and customs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="book">“<span class="smcap">Ohio Archæological and Historical Society,
vol. III.</span>”</h3>

<p>We have received the third volume of the
publications of The Ohio Archæological and
Historical Society. This volume is mainly
concerned with the anniversary exercises connected
with the centennial of the settlement
of Gallipolis. Exhaustive papers on “The
French Settlement and Settlers of Gallipolis,”
“The Scioto Company and its Purchase,” and
the “Early Judiciary of Ohio,” attest the historical
value of this volume. It also contains a
report of the sixth annual meeting of the society,
February 19th and 20th, 1891. The secretary
(Mr. A. A. Graham), very pertinently says
in his preface, “The State is now indebted to
the Ohio Archæological and Historical Society
for three valuable historical volumes, and if
the society had done nothing else, its existence
is more than justified.”</p>
